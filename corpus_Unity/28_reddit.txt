GME by now has become a symbol of "power to the retail investor (apes)".

It's amazing to witness that during this economically tough time people are coming together and buying the stock and NOT selling no matter what.

Time, when profit is so precious and risk is unwanted. This shows how powerful retail investor can be once they unit.

Their will could break the backs of seasoned Hedge funds in a day and bring down the whole system in a week or two.

I applaud the strength and unity common investors have shown no matter what happens in the future with GME.

GME stock holders / buyers are now worthy of getting called as part of the movement. Because it's not just group of people that are holding the line.

The line is being held globally, from Hongkong, Australia, china, Philippines you name it. This incredible sentiment will bind investors together.

I personally feel if Reddit IPOs then it will turn into Facebook and will no longer allow this free conversation / assembly of people and their thoughts.

But while it lasts, I want to congratulate every ape for doing what they did and still doing, hodling.

It's easy for millionaires and billionaires to hold but not for a common man like you and me who are getting whipped by this virus.

Bravo:

Apes - all over the world who are holding the line, still.

Reddit - for not turning into twitter / fb and shutting down the group.

Reddit mods - for managing the exponential growth of posts and users from 4M to 9.5M with 3 months.

Cuban - support and ideas given to retail investors 

Musk - supporting the cause

Ryan cohen - for believing in GME

DFV - :D For not being a cat and liking the stock.

We all need to take a moment and think about how far we have come. We may go to the moon and (worst case) we may not but it's very worth while to acknowledge our progress and feel good about it.

Isn't it?
