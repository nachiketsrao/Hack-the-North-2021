Preface: I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice.

Napoleon said, "Unity of command is essential to the economy of time ... by directing all one's force to a single point a breach might be made, and the equilibrium of opposition destroyed."

Degenerates,

The past two weeks have shown us the power of unity. We can do incredible things when we're together, and that is what has kept us going. However, I see so many arguments, so much hatred, so much anger. THAT'S WHAT THE HEDGE FUNDS WANT. They want to see us disunified, they want to see us mad. Our strength is in our numbers, and we must prioritize cohesion above all else. The bots, the disinformation, the lies, what have been their goal? **They want us to fall apart, and at this moment, we are doing just that.** We must hold this line *together.* We must fight *together.* WE WILL NOT LET THEM DEFEAT US! HOLD! I AM WILLING TO LOSE IT ALL IF I HAVE TO, *BUT WE WILL TAKE THEM DOWN!* IT IS BLOOD THAT MOVES THE WHEELS OF HISTORY, AND WE WILL HAVE MELVIN'S!

We have not lost the war. If we have, why the disinformation? Why the ladder attacks? Why the continued trade restrictions? *It's because we're winning.* I might be down 83% right now, but I bought more. I want to continue the battle.

Ape together, strong. Let's make sure it stays that way.

Buy the dip and hold the line. I assure you, we'll be fine.
