**Update 3/18 pre-close**

Looks like VXX was the right idea and I mis-timed the entry and therefore my strike. This was a good but hard lesson for me, but I‚Äôm excited because as you probably know by now my whole thing is learning and improvement. 

**Update 3/18 morning:**

*Whales to Watch: Revenge* edition coming tomorrow. If you think I‚Äôm taking this tier 1 whooping lying down you got another thing coming üò§ 

**Update 3/18 Opening Bell**

Well, on the bright side, CS and DB are having pretty nice weeks üò¨ üò¨ 

**UPDATE 3/17 After Hoursish**

Before the close, there‚Äôs a lot of events tomorrow at spotrambo if you need a YOLO to wash the taste of VXX out your mouth like I do. 

**UPDATE 3/17 mid day **

üö® JEROME‚ÄôS COMMITMENT TO RATES AND CHILLNESS WITH INFLATION IS SENDING THE VIX TO GOD DAMN SINGLE DIGITS üö® 

and guess what. I‚Äôm not selling. 

**UPDATES PreMarket 3/17:**

VIX? üôè ü•∫

Added a really interesting (to me) play for tomorrow at spotrambo.com. **SLDB** had two  unusual options orders on my non UW scanners yesterday for the 7.50 strike. [They also have a nice little conference pump coming tomorrow](https://i.imgur.com/qw8rxXu.jpg) ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

**UPDATE 3/16 close-ish (gotta run)**

Are ya winning son? Hoping for some fireworks tomorrow, but kudos to MA putting up a fight on a weird day. 

Yes I‚Äôm still holding VXX. Yes my heart still aches. 

PS Starbucks annual shareholder meeting up on spotrambo.com. Could be a play after today‚Äôs PT upgrades 

**Update 3/16 Open**

VXX absolutely ragdolling your boy, as is tradition. I‚Äôll never sell because every time I do it goes 20% the next trading day.  

Thank God I found a tier 1 for next week I‚Äôm in love with. Also some tasty new events over at spotrambo.com to help you get out of today‚Äôs GUH like CRSR ALLO etc

**update AH 3/15**

Mixed movement overall with a couple tier 2 killing it BUT GOOD GOD VXX FADE ME FAM!

Bagholding with my held high for now. Somebody in the comments mentioned purchasing VXX Wednesday due to a nasty contango on the futures. I should‚Äôve listened. 

**Another 3/15 morning Update**

Ahhh yea, VXX üòé ‚ò†Ô∏è 

****

**Update 3/15 morning**: There was some I really liked but forgot to mention here like AMD, they‚Äôre listed over at spotrambo.com 

Grabbed some VXX at 13.82 some NOK at about 4.30 and MA at 381.96. 4/1‚Äôs, 14 4.50 390. Grabbed more VXX than anything cuz I‚Äôm nervous.

Guys, your boy AllDatDalton has a problem.  

Sure, it's a little fun when it pops, but after buying VXX and holding overnight, it always gives me the hangover of loss.  It always ends the same: my account is in disarray, I feel a sense of hopelessness, and everything in my life I'd worked toward to that point is eviscerated by terms like "Stimulus Checks set to arrive..."

But *this* time...this time it really could be different.  **The FOMC is coming up this week starting March 16th**.  [For the unitiated, this is an event where not much is often decided but much is bet on; the FED gives their guidance in matters including‚Äîbut not limited to--Quantitive Easing, Interest Rate speculation, and Bond Yield Curve control.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/think.ing.com/amp/article/us-what-to-watch-at-the-march-fed-meeting/)  Market volatility precedes it, as the oracles all scramble to determine what poppa Pow might or might not say or do‚Äîif the man farted into the microphone and walked away, VXX would probably climb 15%...the tension is *palpable*.

**This one couldn‚Äôt come at a more precarious time, as good news is now bad news**.  As reopening moves full steam ahead and we get a massive injection of economic stimulus, people are beginning to stop taking JPow at his word.  He promises a steady hand, he promises no interest rate increases, he says bond yield curve control is always on the table....and yet deep pockets flee en masse from stonks and into treasuries as the good times roll. 

**You see, the problem with the FED right now is no matter what they say, investors see the inevitable trend**.  They're betting there is only so long the FED can continue to artificially support the market--and only so long there will be reason to-- as indexes roar, the actual economy improves, and vaccine distribution is, for the most part, on track to return us to a world of pseudo-normalcy by summer.  It doesn't help that the FED stays verbally doveish while quietly doing things like declining to speak on Yield Curves definitively during speaking engagements, and [quietly ended the term repo m lending program](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/fed-ending-term-repos-reflects-liquidity-feast-for-dealers). 

**My choice here is between treasury-tickers and the VXX**-- last time I was making this choice I went with VXX on the DD, and that choice didn't pan out until the second week.  I said then, reflecting on that week‚Äôs losers, that I should have chosen treasuries...**so why didn‚Äôt I this time with the opportunity right here?**  *VXX is just absurdly low right now, trading under $14*.  I'm not saying the pop will happen Tuesday or Wednesday, but it may, and dollars to donuts if you hold a VXX 14 or 14.50c 4/1 you'll make some money at some point if you don't hold too long after it makes a run.  Also, if Jerome breathes a word about Yield Control they will plummett. 

**This intro is also my way of admitting my confidence level this week is low‚Äîthere is too much potential for chop**.  Sure, I could be wrong and we go to the moon once stimmies start hitting people‚Äôs accounts, and that argument is fair as I see some of the new age commodities mooning to ATH over the wekend.  But, for the most part, I'd rather put on a jimmy hat this week and hope my safe picks don't come back burning me.

But anyway, **you didn‚Äôt come here for my half-baked philosophy on impending market volatility.  YOU CAME CUZ YOU HEARD WE GOT THEM BAGGERS**.  So, let's talk whales.

***

**Shoutout to unusual whales who makes this possible through letting me share their pick info! They‚Äôre great!**

**Last week‚Äôs lovers**: **DKNG** absolutely crushed it. **Tier 2**, on a sustained measurement over the week, actually defeated Tier 1.  **OCGN SQ EBAY** all had magnificent moments in the sun aided by that crazy **4% NASDAQ Day**.

**Mid-week Pivot**: The **F** call mid-week was clutch on the 13c, and now it's sitting above that price to end the week.  Also, I know y'all were feeling the heat on that **T** mid-week pivot call, but Friday brought us the glory. I was sweating though üòÖ 

**Last week‚Äôs lesson**: **GE** and **DIS** were hotter than shit wrapped in tin foil coming out the gate on Monday, then they hit us with that nasty curve.  **News broke that GE was closing a huge deal on Sunday, which gave me continued optimism, and then they just demolished the call holders with that fucking reverse split**--if you say you saw that coming, you's a damn lie.  DIS got great news, but it was crossing a key 200 resistance number (is that TA?  I don't know man, I think so), and couldn't hold.  I **think the key here is it‚Äôs okay to take a pause on the pick if it‚Äôs hot fresh out the gate the week of the RAMBO.  There will be more picks.  The other lesson here is that when the event is big enough, it plays like an earnings rather than a pump**.  DKNG, for example, had pump written all over it.  It was more about future potential than earnings in the description. Conversely, the GE annual event had an ER feel, particularly in articles I read Tuesday.  **Meme stock pump event=good.  Boomer stock boring investor event=be wary.  Stock crossing a big round resistance number leading into an event=watch how it behaves, and if it dips catch it post-event.**

**‚ÄùNever lost, just ran out of time‚Äù**: Someone pointed out in a comment the M 3/26 20c i went with from two DD's ago is puh-rinting.  Should've held I guess.  Womp Womp.

**Tier 1**: Dice I'm Rolling with this Week (intriguing whale bets, with RAMBO (non-ER pumps), sectors or tickers I like) *disclaimer: this may be choppy as week enter positions on dips, long dates*

[MA](https://i.imgur.com/ufR3TrB.jpg) ([3/23 B of A electronic payments symposium](https://investor.mastercard.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx))

When I said playing it safe I guess I meant it lol.  MA is going from your grandfather's favorite holding to an interesting FinTech play that is showing malleability in a fast-paced industry.
[They're doing cool stuff like this merger with Payoneer](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/10/fintech-payoneer-partners-with-mastercard-ahead-of-3-billion-spac-.html) and, for better or worse, they've joined the growing list of companies linking their perceived fate to the commodity that shall not be mentioned.  

I just generally like the stock, but I think this conference presentation will be a great catalyst as they have a chance to expose some of their new school thinking and get some nice quotes for FinTwit pumps.  Getting in early in case stimulus excitement waves can give a little push in banking and financial processors, but weary of entry because of FOMC.

[NOK](https://i.imgur.com/EL3aSk8.jpg) ([Nokia Capital Markets Day 3/18](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news-and-events/events-calendar/investor-relations-events/capital-markets-day/))

**Me two paragraphs ago**: I'm playing it safe this week.  **Also me**: Let's pick a failed meme that is a favorite of foreign bots.  

Someone in the comments on my last DD was pumping this, and I kinda didn't pay it to much attention at first.  But, they had some interesting things say about NOK, and convinced me that the foreign de-listing wasn't as big a deal as people were intimating. 

Sometimes you gotta plug your nose--*hate the stonk, love the RAMBO*.  **The general consensus around this event is that this is moment NOK needs to do SOMETHING to please investors**.  NOK is also sticking to the messaging that this a strategy reset of sorts.  The key pump factor here is *whether or not they will set a definitive dividend policy*--that's what I'm watching for.  If we get the dividend announcement, the sky is the limit.  If we don't, well, bail out quickly, because this sinking ship may head for Davey Jones' Locker (I'm so corny bruh üò≠ ).

[Somebody did a solid DD write-up on NOK](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m33vsq/full_diligence_post_on_nokia_nok_ahead_of_capital/) pre-event at r/investing.  I'm sure the sub will be appalled that I'm mining their shit for options speculation lol.

[VXX](https://i.imgur.com/CdGUT8U.jpg) (FOMC March 16-18th discussing potential yield curve control, etc)

The intro pretty much states where I'm at on this. **I like the 14c 4/1**--my plan is to wait for an assumed green open Monday, and see if I can pick up a nice premium price just before the classic fade.  **I‚Äôm going to hold until it pops, through the FOMC RAMBO**, and if the markets don't go red i'll probably trim some for a loss but keep holding for a level of general volatility.  If we open red Monday, I'll let action settle and push out to the 14.50c probably.  I dunno, I'm just a dog chasing cars.

**Tier 2**: Watching with great interest

[AAPL](https://i.imgur.com/C40J4QR.jpg): [Rumored product launch event on 3/23](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.indiatoday.in/amp/technology/news/story/apple-may-launch-airpods-3-ipad-pro-update-and-more-products-at-march-23-event-1777186-2021-03-09). Thanks /u/7thprincess 

[ABNB](https://i.imgur.com/XinYxt5.jpg): No rambo, but look at this crazy ass whale bet that came through with hilarious VOL/OI. People are betting on reopening, sure, but this feels welrd as hell and i love it. 

[CRSR](https://i.imgur.com/W0soBkU.jpg): No whale betting, but some other UOA and I am very intrigued by their event coming up on the 16th, **The Macquarie Consumer Bright Ideas Conference**.  Sounds pumpish, and they're trotting the CEO out.

[GPRO](https://i.imgur.com/tdX3a7c.jpg): Tons of consistent whale betting matching performance of an uptrend.  Been on a tear, so may need a little dip to get a good entry point, but I want to follow the money on this one.

[CS](https://i.imgur.com/5D7VBrd.jpg)/[DB](https://i.imgur.com/QnUyMK4.jpg): boring financials plays without UW bets, but still pumping nicely in other UOA registers.  CS has a conference presentation the morning of 3/16 and is releasing their annual report on 3/18. DB has a presentation on 3/18.

****

Remember, this week could be super flukey, so long dates, timing your entry, and the ability to HODL are key.  I'm genuinely not excited about this week, not gonna lie.

**TLDR**

This week could be choppy with FOMC, so I'm grabbing some **VXX**, playing a longer **MA** call for a spicy safe haven, and buying **NOK** leading into their capital markets day as a purely speculative play.

**AAPL** has a rumored product launch coming on the 23rd, **CRSR** has an interesting conference, and **GPRO** continues to recieve bullish whale bets.

Inbox always open.  Happy hunting everybody.
