You people are legit insane. Holding a dying stock and screaming from the roof tops that anything happening you don’t like is some mystery hedge fund trying to destroy your beloved subreddit...

The fact is, you Neanderthals didn’t sell to make money, you held too long and are being burned alive for what? For unity with people you’ve never met and never will?

Grow up, this isn’t some high school clique, this is real people losing real money by the bucketfuls and all I see in here is encouragement to hold longer and lose more.

I still have GME and am hoping it does go up again so I can get out as fast as I can, because I was in the green and sold twice but bought back in when I knew it was a bad play. Did it anyway just because of the rhetoric. 

Don’t be like me. Get the fuck out and stay out if you’re not already in up to your eyeballs in these worthless meme stocks.

It’s not a hedge fund conspiracy, it’s the fact that regular, rational thinking people got out when they should have, like I did twice before, and they didn’t go back in exactly like they should have done.
