I am a die-hard Unity fan & was obsessed for weeks leading up to the IPO to make sure I got in at first chance. This wasn't intended to be a swing trade for me, in fact this stock is the only reason I ever started investing at all & was the first trading I ever did, but I got fired two months ago & haven't found a new gig yet & I was able to sell most of my shares this morning to pay my rent :)

I do plan on reinvesting, but for now I just wanna say- thanks stonks, u rly do be goin up.

Love y'all stay retarded.

p.s. If you don't know, Robinhood will actually write & mail a check for you, in case your rental company is also still living in the forking 90s and make you mail a check to Florida.
