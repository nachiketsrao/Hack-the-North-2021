My portfolio is pretty much mainly made up on Tech and EV stocks. I’m looking to invest in 2 or 3 more, ideally in a different sector to diversify a little but it’s not crucial. The hope, like everyone, is to find the ‘next big thing’ I have quite a high risk tolerance. 

After doing some research my thoughts on one’s that could do well are
SBE - Dunno if Tesla will take away much of their market though
ICLN - Seems expensive atm from what people are saying
PLTR - This one seems pretty high risk but with the chance of strong returns
BLDP
LIT
FAN

I know some of these are connected to EV and Tech. Lithium and batteries seems like it will grow. 

SQ is another one. I dunno if people think this will continue to do well or if it’s at a pretty high price currently?

Be great to get people’s thoughts on the above stocks and any others that have great potential that I’ve failed to mention. I’m open to any sector tbh. Clean Energy seems like it’s going to only grow but I don’t know much about the space and I’m struggling to find anything I’m really confident on, hence ICLN and FAN. 

Thanks
