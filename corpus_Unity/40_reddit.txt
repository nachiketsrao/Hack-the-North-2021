Party is over people. If you guys notice obviously MMS took over the entire market. Everything looks like a penny stock. Close out all your positions and donâ€™t open anything until they start playing fair. Calls/puts iron condor they all know how to decay those contracts and doing it perfectly well. Also if you guys notice there is no more volume in the ENTIRE MARKET. All the biggest moves happen in after hours exactly what Cramer said. Switch to stocks or boycott this shit and only way we can win is to be united.
