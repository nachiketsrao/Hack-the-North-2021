Look, I'll keep this short and simple.

Unity is a software developer, and about 60-70% of mobile games use their tech. It took a massive dive after earnings. Despite great profits and revenue, their slightly slower growth projections led to a massive overreaction, and it's been slowly bleeding as the market has remained down.
 
Even aside from the fundamentals of the stock, Cathie Woods has been steady in her support. $ARKK acquired a nice 764,700 (!) shares on February 5th (at around $130/share). Mama Woods is still confident in this stock. As should you--there was nothing so terribly wrong about their earnings that they deserved to dump to $128, and now 116. Mobile games are still doing great, and their revenue will continue to be strong. This is a perfect dip buying opportunity. I fully expect it to return to at least 130 in a couple of weeks.

I am also sorry to those who bought the dip at $130. But, if you have monthlies, your calls should be fine.
