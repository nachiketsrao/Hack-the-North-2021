Why would I search through thousands of companies looking for a 10 bagger when I could just look at what the smartest, most experienced investors are doing, and then copy them. I'm just an asslicker

oh yea THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE THIS IS PURELY EDUCATIONAL GAMBLE RESPONSIBLY

>Forgive me retards. This is a long read. In order to transmit what I now understand to you I need to use this medium of ‘text’ which can be difficult, because it requires us to read. Not one of our strenghts.

Now this strategy has worked for me for a while, but I have been burnt badly in the process. I willy-nilly copied Michael Burry investing in Tailored Brands, which went bankrupt. I fortunately saved my investment before it went bust while I was travelling abroad. I got stuck in a overseas country due to Covid…before the whole market crash. I sold all of my stocks before the crash because I thought, after seeing what happened in Italy, America would soon realise the extent of the problem and the market would appreciate the consequences.

This lead me to my current strategy. Copy, but first understand. Even geniuses make mistakes. And hey, maybe my smooth brain will wrinkle a bit in the process! The process to understand utilizes intense DD, intense research, all in the efforts to increase the probability of success.

I am not nearly as smart as them, but if we can stand on the shoulders of giants then maybe one day we can see further than even they saw. (we love you B-man)

**The case for Uniti:**

Daddy Burry showed on his 13-F that he’s invested in a number of different stocks. Most of them in inlation-hedged industries. Uniti is a Telecommunications REIT (no REIT is not short for RETARD). Uniti is a one of a kind. There is no other public business that does exactly what it does. The closest competitor is Zayo. Similar but not the same are Crown Castle internation corp, but they are extremely overvalued and their name is gay. (I have nothing against gays please don’t cancel me LGBT community).

What does Uniti do? It’s pretty weird- they Buy the ‘property’ of Fiber and copper lines that transmit data across the U.S. FROM telecommunication companys. Then they rent it back to them. It helps the other telecoms up free capital and has tax advantages.

Long-story short, they rent Fiber to telecommunications companies and also have their own Fiber segment. Once the intial “anchor” network has been made Renting FIBER becomes incrementally profitable. Super HIGH margin and super duper easy. It also creates very predictable cash flows because these dudes sign super long IRU leases (leases you cannot void).

**1) Why did the stock get so reckt, but Uniti doesn’t even make profit, OMG Uniti debt is huge.**

1. Uniti was orginally spun-off from Windstream. Imagine like a big beyblade and then you spin it and a smaller bleyblade comes out of the big beyblade. Uniti became its own company and inherited all its assets from Daddy Windstream.  
After the Spin-off Uniti took most of ALL the fiber and copper in the ground and rented it BACK to Windstream. Daddy Windstream became Uniti’s biggest and ONLY customer- diversification is for Pusaaysss. So then Daddy Windstream accumulated too much debt and headed for bankruptcy. Imagine your biggest and only client going bust. Obviously this is like super bad and so Uniti’s share price gets smashed.  
Then Windstream files for Bankruptcy AND Windstreams Creditors are NOT happy becuause of the spin-off ect.  
So *yes* the company’s future was not certain at all and the stock price reflected that.  
**Then Uniti had a settlement with Windstream and the settlement was sooo good.**  
In the settlment Uniti got exclusive rights to 18.1 MILLION of Windstreams fiber and got some Windstream assets. Uniti’s side of the deal required them to issue shares to Windstream (to compensate windstreams creditors) and also to pay windstream money (24Million every quarter until 490M is paid off). + Windstream can make them repair and extend the lines that Windstream rents from Uniti.  
This settlement is great news for Uniti and happened last year. The share price basically doubled on the news- but I believe it’s still *moderately* undervalued (super undervalued compared to Tech and other bubbles). To be honest, I kinda missed the boat. This company was a GREAT buy at EBITDA/EV of like 5 back when share-price was 6$- (now at $12 \*sulk\*).
2. 2 and 3 will both go here. Unti makes huges margins but doesn’t make a profit because their debt costs are so high. This isn’t going to be a problem into 2021 and 2022 because FITCH upgraded their credit rating. They have already refinanced 1.1Billion of their debt- go look at sec.gov 8Ks. It’s recent. With this news I think in 2021 and 2022 Uniti can SIGNIFICANTLY reduce their interest cost, and expand their magins bigly so as to start printing tendies for their shareholders. **The worst is over. The worst was the settlement, which turned out super good.**  
Their Revenue is like \~260Million per quarter and their interest expense was like 100 MIllion, like WTFFF. When I saw this I got worried, but upon further research I realised it’s actually fine. With the recent re-financing they will reduce their interest expense almost by \~16M. Still not enough I think…then if you start reading through the earnings transcripts you see that the CEO and the CFO aren’t even remotely worried about their debt- why is this?  
Uniti’s revenues are extremely stable, they are IRU leases which cannot be voided until the contract ends. They can also do these cool things called Opco-Propco transactions (which they recently did) which brings a bunch of cash upfront that they can use to pay down debt (If they need to). The CEO and the CFO aren’t worried about the debt now because they can refinance it at lower rates later AND they are more excited about all the opportunities in their market. They have (57-18)= 39M of sales in the pipeline most of which are ***“lease-up”*** sales which means they just add onto their existing network which means SUPER HIGH MARGINS because the network is already there, they don’t need to invest much more capex into it to realise these revenues.

&#x200B;

So Mr CFO and CEO are going to grow their EBITDA this year. This increase will better their credit rating. Big players in the industry have a debt cost of around 1.5-3%. Uniti's was like 7% average until recently. Imagine they more than half this cost in the coming 2 years? That’s like +50\~M more cash to shareholders.

**As of right now we have a company “Uniti” that’s problems are pretty much behind it. A management team that is looking very forward to the future. Trading at an EBITDA/EV value of around 9 (based on latest latest earnings).**

An EBITDA/EV of 9 is not super low. But it is still low when you look at competitors and this industry. This industry is based on super stable income from all their IRU leases (Leases that cannot be voided)- windstream even had to continue to pay THROUGH bankruptcy, so that’s how NOT-voided these contracts are lol.

I wrote half of this report yesterday, and then the earnings came out….so heres another half based on what I see…

Huge up-tick in revenue and EBITDA from leasing up their Leasing business. Way better than what I expected- *I guess the management wasn’t fibbing about the opportunities in the market*. They have also managed to bring their leverage ratio (debt/capital) down to 5.71. HUGE improvement. They were running at 6+ in 2020. They now have a leverage ratio that can compare nicely to peers AND give them a better arguement when trying to re-finance their debt at even lower rates.

I’m taking a smallllly position in them because with their growth outlook, and undervaluedness compared to peers.

In September or so one of their biggest shareholders, who came out owning shares due to the settlement might dump their shares. I bloody hope they do because I will scoop this thing up anywhere below $8 per share.

Oh and hey….

Inflation is on its way boys and traps

Manfacturing prices which then leads to increases in CPI
