SKLZ family and future family...

I took some time and created an accurate DD resource for anyone new and curious about SKLZ and its prospects as an investment going forward. This should serve as a good jumping off point for anyone who wants to research further.

To the best of my knowledge, everything here is FACT and easily verifiable with a google search and/or listening to some of the recent interviews with the CEO, who by the way, is borderline giddy in some of them at the prospect of finally going public.

So without further ado... This is why I sincerely believe that being able to buy into this company at the current valuation is a VERY rare opportunity with huge long-term upside potential.

MARKET GROWTH>>>

\-The mobile game market is currently experiencing explosive growth.

10 years ago it was an 8B market. Today it is 68B. In 2025 it is projected to be a 150B market.

\-Video games are rapidly becoming the leading form of entertainment.

\-Already more popular than books, movies and music, video games are on a path to even eclipse TV.

\-SKLZ DOES NOT CREATE GAMES. SKLZ provides a PLATFORM for game developers to monetize their creations through competition.

\-There are currently 10M game developers world-wide that are are looking for the best way to monetize.

\-Before SKLZ, game developers relied on advertising and in-app purchases to monetize their creations.

\-SKLZ has found that developers who monetize their games through competition (game-centric) instead of advertising are up to 5X More profitable.

\-SKLZ will run 2B (yes BILLION) tournaments in 2022.To put that in perspective, that's 1700 tournaments EVERY SECOND.

\-SKLZ user engagement (minutes a day spent gaming) trumps many other popular platforms.

MARKET OPPORTUNITY>>>

\-90% of SKLZ revenue comes from North America

\-TAM outside of North America is roughly 4X as large.

\-SKLZ currently has 2.7M monthly active users.

\-Total MAU world-wide is 2.7 Billion.

That mean currently SKLZ has only penetrated .1% (that's 1/10th of one percent) of the potential market. It's almost impossible to imagine a longer runway for potential growth.

MOAT>>>

\-SKLZ Competitive moat is its Anti-cheat tech which involved years of data science development.

\-SKLZ measures 300 individual data points a minute during gameplay.

Think McAfee Anti-virus but specifically designed for competition-based games.

\-58 issued or pending PATENTS for this Anti-cheat technology.

INVESTORS>>>

The people behind Flying Eagle Acquisition Corporation, the company that merged with SKLZ to take them public are the same people that took DKNG public through Diamond Eagle. Yes... These are the Exact Same Guys.

\-PIPE investors are of the highest quality.

\-Wellington, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Nueberger Berman.

\-Existing SKLZ stockholders and PIPE investors have agreed to a 24-month lock up period, a testament to all involved party's faith in the business.

\-SKLZ has been able to deliver incredibly consistant, predictable growth since 2017.

\-In 2017, SKLZ met with Flying Eagle (DKNG guys) and provided them with growth projections for 3 years out.

\-SKLZ has met its growth projections every quarter within 1%-5% since 2017.

\-SKLZ is expected to grow at 57% CAGR through 2022.

FINANCIALS 2020 Q#/YTD>>>

\-Third Quarter Revenue of 60M, Up 92% YoY-Revenue YTD of 162M, up 91% Over Prior Year-Affirming Full Year Guidance of 255M

\-Gross Margins of 90%+-Long-term projected EBITDA of over 30%.

VALUATION DISPARITY>>>

\-At $20, SKLZ is valued at Approximately 12X 2022 Revenue (P/S 12)

\-Currently SKLZ is valued at Roughly 24X 2020 Revenue (P/S of 24)

\-Unity Software, a company in a very similar space, is currently valued at 60X Revenue (P/S of 60)

CEO>>>

\-SKLZ CEO Andrew Paradise is a Big-Idea kind of a guy.

\-He previously founded and sold his startup AisleBuyer, a company that let consumers check out in stores via their mobile phones, to intuit in 2012.

\-He is always talking about his company's "100-year vision". That vision- Creating the "competition layer" of the internet.

\-My favorite quote from him from a recent interview....

"What a lot of people don't understand about our business is that SKLZ is not so much a video game system as much as it is.... (wait for it...... ;) a DATA AND FINANCIAL PAYMENTS SYSTEM.

Aka... FINTECH.

Big things in the future here folks, short AND long-term.

As always... Good Luck!!!!
