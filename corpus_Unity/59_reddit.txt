The momentum would have created a high energy at GME and AMC to know that they have got free publicity and public support. At the moment any sensible management will try to capitalize on it. It would not be surprising to see GME take the netflix route and go from being a BM store to more of an online presence. The new hiring show that they might be headed in that direction. All they need is to ride the wave we have created for them.

I work in Strategy and Innovation and I am sure game stop has similar people on their roles who are trying to figure out how to capitalize the new found fame. I can think of atleast 10 different things they can do, they probably have plenty more ideas.

The way GME can thank us is, by proving that they are a $1000 company and not the $0 the HF thought. 

If GME launches some kind of subscription or online service, I will be one of the first to sign up. 

Ride the ðŸŒŠ. Unity in strength
