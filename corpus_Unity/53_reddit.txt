Fellow autists, "Don't X!" and "it isn't Y yet" is posting to, and sharing your fears! The media loves quoting these. Don't let them! 

Don't get me wrong, loss porn is still great too! If you sold, and you lost, the desire is to be honest, admit defeat, move on, and/or at least reap sweet sympathy karma is a positive thing! 

But, if you're still holding, post your desired outcomes, encouragements, and spites ("ticker says I'm down, but I say hold long") and let the media quote those instead! They can't break what isn't broken. We hold long and we hold strong! Share the love! Share the unity!

This is not financial advice. This is not mental advice. I'm not a professional of any kind. I just have these ðŸ’ŽðŸ™ŒðŸ’Ž
