Hear me out. I know we need unity in GME but it will come down eventually. $NOK is the last ticker that hasnâ€™t popped like $GME, $BBBY, $BB, and $AMC. Start the yolo into NOK you fucking retards itâ€™s $5 a fucking share. Just look what AMC did in after hours?? 

Donâ€™t be a primadonna pussy and buy NOK

 (and GME of course itâ€™s still running)
