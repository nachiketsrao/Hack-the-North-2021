After 2020 my hope in a lot of things had starting disappearing.. more debt in my small business lingering over my head now than I ever had imagined. I caught on to what y’all were doing in January I was just amazed.. the point, the bright light you are shining on on a dark broken system.. but the unity in it all. I have a few shares, nothin much, but really, I’m just so damn proud of y’all. In a world of separation, fear, and chaos.. you’ve restored some of my hope that the bad doesn’t outweigh the good and a positive balance can still happen when people come together and I’m forever grateful for the reminder at a pretty dark time.. so for what it’s worth, thanks. ❤️
