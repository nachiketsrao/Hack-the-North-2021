Following WSB for the last 2 months, I have noticed many stonks mentioned. Among the top 5 is $CLOV andHere is the thing about $CLOV:

**Clover Health** (NASDAQ:**CLOV**) started  trading on the Nasdaq Exchange back in January after completing its merger with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings (NYSE:IPOC).

Hindenburg Hedge fund had taken a large position against spacs in general [(Google: Hindenburg vs spacs)](https://www.google.com/search?q=hindenburg+hedge+fund+vs+spacs&bih=698&biw=1280&hl=en&ei=xi2bYJL5MdfY-gSE86a4Cw&oq=hindenburg+hedge+fund+vs+spacs&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAM6BQghEKABOggIIRCgARCLAzoICCEQqwIQiwM6BQghEKsCOggIIRAWEB0QHlC3KFjPNWDINmgBcAB4AIABY4gBpQaSAQE5mAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpergBAsABAQ&sclient=gws-wiz&ved=0ahUKEwiS9Pu5_cLwAhVXrJ4KHYS5CbcQ4dUDCA4&uact=5), and thus $CLOV merger with a SPAC had become one of their targets: [Hindenburg CLOV report](https://hindenburgresearch.com/clover/).

Hindenburg has been shorting $CLOV since FEBRUARY 4, 2021, and then a law suit against $CLOV appeared by Robbins LLP (lawyers), and guess who hired them: Hindenburg Hedge Fund [Hindenburg Robbins LLP](https://www.google.com/search?q=hindenburg+robbins+LLP&hl=en&biw=1280&bih=698&ei=bDCbYK36Dt-90PEP5quV8A8&oq=hindenburg+robbins+LLP&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAM6BwgAEEcQsAM6CggAEJECEEYQ-QE6CwguEMcBEK8BEJECOggILhDHARCjAjoCCAA6BAgAEEM6BQgAEJECOgQILhBDOgIILjoGCAAQFhAeOgUIIRCgAToICCEQoAEQiwM6BQghEKsCOgcIIRAKEKABUMZTWLmtAWCvsAFoBHACeACAAZwBiAHPE5IBBDE2LjmYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6sAEAyAEIuAECwAEB&sclient=gws-wiz&ved=0ahUKEwit4P78_8LwAhXfHjQIHeZVBf4Q4dUDCA4&uact=5)

Since then they have been bombarding with press releases of $CLOV being under investigation (misleading title as if the FBI or SEC is investigating).

If you read about the lawsuit, it's all about the SPAC merger, because as far as it comes to CLOV, there are no problems. 

The fundamentals are strong with CLOV still growing in the hundreds of millions per quarter (not $500,000 like MVIS) and the technicals show that it can't get any lower.

Hindenburg taking a large stance against spacs, had made them overlook $CLOV  as an actual success, and they are spending a lot of money to try and cover their shorts,

CLOV is the real deal when in comes to a squeeze because it actually has value. If there is no unity behind this, it means that the whole movement stopped with GME and AMC and that is all for stonks (at least for me). 

I myself am invested with 1200 shares at  an average of $9.20  and it is currently at $7.95, so i am feeling the shit, but we shall see on this Monday's earning call who actually won?
