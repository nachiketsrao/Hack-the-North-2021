I’m not going to buy puts because the stock has still some room to go up a bit before dipping but after yesterday I’m pretty confident we’ll be seeing a dip to the $87-$90 range before going up again but once the stock is in the $89-$92 range don’t buy in because it’ll show small growth before dropping hard then shooting up 

This is just an idea I’d recommend you do some DD and you’ll find the same thing I find
