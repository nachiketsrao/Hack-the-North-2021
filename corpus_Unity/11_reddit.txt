FINAL EDIT:  VMS Eve has landed safely. Thanks to our pilots Kelly Latimer and Michael Masucci for flying the mothership today and their vital role in helping VSS Unity complete today’s spaceflight!

\- Take off! VMS Eve and VSS Unity have taken to the skies above Spaceport America, New Mexico.

\- VMS Eve is taking VSS Unity to a release altitude of 44,000ft. The climb to release will take approximately 60 minutes.

\- VMS Eve and VSS Unity are now at 30,000 ft, nearly half-way to release altitude.

\- Approximately 10 minutes from release, VSS Unity switches to its own battery power for avionics and control systems, and performs electrical, feather system and flight control checks.

\- VSS Unity is in its launch configuration and pilots are readying the rocket motor system. Awaiting clearance for release from Mission Control.

\- Release, release, release! VSS Unity has successfully separated from VMS Eve.

\- VSS Unity’s rocket motor has been ignited by our pilots CJ Sturckow and Dave Mackay.

\- Rocket motor shutdown. Momentum will keep VSS Unity travelling upwards towards apogee.

\- VSS Unity enters coast phase. Tail-booms raised into “feathered” re-entry position.

\- VSS Unity, our two pilots and [NASA\_Technology](https://twitter.com/NASA_Technology) supported experiments are now in space.

\- VSS Unity reaches apogee.

\- VSS Unity is descending back to Earth.

\- The feather has been lowered and VSS Unity is now gliding smoothly back to the runway at Spaceport America.

A successful test flight + landing!

EDIT: - Touch down, VSS Unity.  **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

EDIT2: Their smoke trail looks the same as their stock will do in the next week (had to insert this joke, sorry).

EDIT3: For people who were panicking on twitter due to motor shutdown - it's per procedures, it's what the motor HAS and HAD to do, everything is perfect.

Congrats to fellow bagholders, this was a fun one to watch!  **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**
