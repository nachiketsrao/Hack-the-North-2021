You guys know the story of Robinhood? A swashbuckling thief that stole from the rich and gave to the poor? Cute, right? Well if you have a brain and have been alive in America for more than at least 15 years, you know it never works like that. The same applies for Robinhood. They are on the side of Wall Street and they do not care about you. When retail buyers finally got a leg up and figured out how to get their (relatively small) piece of the pie (a pie that has always been served off their backs mind you), these hedge fund shoe shiners stole away their stocks and locked them into their positionsâ€” answering a witch-hunt for market manipulators with stone-cold market manipulation. Theyâ€™ve done everything they said they were against and you should take a stand. 

This platform is a thing for good and every public figure who wants to be free of Wall Streetâ€™s grip has said so. There are beautiful mods here bringing together a powerful community of people from all over the spectrum (and yes THAT spectrum too) and I hope everyone follows their guidance for how to file complaints, beat them at their own game, and curbing hate speech while doing so. HAVE FAITH YE BEAUTIFUL RETARDS. THEY HAVE NOT BEATEN YOU YET. NOW IS THE TIME FOR UNITY AND STANDING UP FOR THE LITTLE GUY OF ALL COLORS, BACK-ROUNDS, AND MENTAL CAPACITIES. FILE YOUR COMPLAINTS JOIN THE CLASS ACTIONS, YOU CAN BE THE REAL ROBINHOODS.

...GME to the fucking moon babyðŸš€ðŸŒ™
