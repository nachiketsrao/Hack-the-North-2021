Two weeks ago I posted this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b31imu/dd\_uniti\_group/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b31imu/dd_uniti_group/)  Encouraging people to buy into Uniti.

Today my April calls broke 1000% from when I bought them a week ago.  My August calls (most of what I bought) are up over 100%. Point is ya'll don't listen.  (If you did listen you should take some gains which is the real point of this post)
