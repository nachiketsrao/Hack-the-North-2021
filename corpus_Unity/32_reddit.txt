TL;DR - No. You will have to read this one. It took a lot of research and typing to prepare this for you. But personally I'm a GME believer and it WILL fly ðŸš€. 

So you bought GME shares because strangers online told you to and you begin to ask yourself if you are retarded. The answer is yes, yes you are. But there is a good chance you are a lucky retard. If you are FOMO guy you have to decide which scenario is more likely and enter if you believe in happy endings. 
  
There is a lot of noise regarding GME and there is barely any good DD anymore. This is why I decided to put this together. You have to keep in mind that I am a retard myself and not an OG GME gang. I entered GME in January at $19, paper handed in worst possible moment at $32 because I thought squeeze has sqoze. I am now back in the game and reinvested my profit and more back into GME. Only reason why I feel competent to do this is because a) I read a lot about GME and shovel through all the noise to find meaningful info b) apparently no one else is willing to do it properly.  
    
So here it goes from the worst case to the best. All possible scenarios I can think of. If I miss anything or I messed something up, please let me know and I will update this list. This is not a financial advice. You have to make up your own mind and if you can actually read, do your own research.   
  
##**"WE ARE FUCKED!" scenarios:**  
  
***Ryan Cohen played us all (EDIT: it appears this scenario is impossible. Leaving this up as another proof that I am indeed retarded.)***  
In this scenario RC sells or already sold his shares. We have been duped and it all has been pump and dump. We are all royally fucked.  

For this scenario:   
  
* RC, despite what you can read around here, is not your actual daddy. He is a business man looking to make profit.  
  
Against this scenario:  

* RC is fucking rich and if he wanted, he could already retire. 
* It would ruin his credibility.  
  
How do we know it is happening:  
  
* We learn through official paperwork that RC sold his shares, price reaches near 0 within minutes. 
  
My personal opinion: 
   
* Near zero chance this happens. But if its does, Price Target (PT) is very low.  
   

***GME is practically bankrupt***  
It turns out that RC comes in too late. GME is bankrupt in few months.  

For this scenario:   
  
* That was shorters play from the beginning.  
  
Against this scenario:  

* According to DD posted by people on WSB, GME books look good.  
* New console cycle, stimulus money, post COVID optimism all point that GME should be afloat longer then we need them to.  
  
How do we know it is happening:  
  
* We learn through official paperwork that GME is in a very bad condition. 
  
My personal opinion: 
   
* Very low chance that this happens due to againsts. But if its does, Price Target (PT) is 0.  
   
***Shorters pull a fast one on us***  
In this scenario institutions find a way to squeeze margin positions, outplay options and wait out long positions.  
  
For this scenario:   
  
* They have written the rules of the game and honestly, they know much better how to play it then us. 
  
Against this scenario:  
  
* If they could do it they would probably have already done it instead of loosing almost a billion in options last Friday.  
  
How do we know it is happening:  

* Serious price drop on Tuesday despite short restrictions.   
* Price falls in following days below $20 per share and refuses to come back up for a very long time.  

  
My personal opinion:  
  
* Non-zero chance this happens. It is possible. But IMO unlikely because I believe that if they could save their options they would have done it already. PT: uncertain but definitely below $20. $10-$15 if I had to guess.   
   
##**Neutral scenarios:**   
  
***We are in a deadlock aka. "neutral but actually bad"***  
In this case old shorts are actually covered and we have new shorts on our hands. Price volatility and actual price slowly decrease. Both sides play a waiting game. RC and GME are radio silent for few months.    
 
For this scenario:  
  
* Institutions has already proven that they are committed to their shorts. And they will not admit defeat.
* Shorts have more money and patience.
* If shorts are replaced by new ones, they will not bleed (but that's unlikely).  
* We believe, but a lot of us have paper hands and/or can't afford to keep cash frozen to wait this out.  
* Hype will die down and with it our conviction.  
  
Against this scenario:  

* If the price settles above $30 or even better above $35, shorts will bleed money.  
* If the price remains low ($30 or below), there *may* come other large investors for a long position after they realize that this is a good value investment. This would trigger good scenarios.
  
How do we know it is happening:  

* Price volatility decreases over next week or two and settles probably somewhere between $25 and $35. 
  
My personal opinion:  

* Honestly I'm mostly afraid of this scenario. But at the same time it's not very likely that shorts are replaced. Then again, if nothing major happens relativly soon, this is still a likely scenario. PT: $25-$30 for months to come until one side wins.
   
***We are in a deadlock aka. "neutral but actually good"***  
In this case price volatility slowly decreases, and both sides play a waiting game. RC and GME are radio silent for few months. But in this scenario we overcome our collective retardation and show how strong we are through our unity. Price slowly rises over next months as shorts slowly close their positions.   
 
For this scenario:  

* If the price settles above $30 or even better above $35, shorts will bleed money and will be covering their shorts.  
* One should never underestimate autists.   
  
Against this scenario:  

* United retards with diamond hands? Retail investors are market makers? I want to believe that we have that power but lets keep it real.
  
How do we know it is happening:  

* Price volatility decreases over next week or two and settles probably somewhere between $25 and $35. But the trend will become upward after that.
  
My personal opinion:  

* Hard to say. I think some actually good scenarios are more likely then this one.  
   
 
##**Good scenario:**  
  
***Slow and steady short squeeze***  
We win! Shorts are out of ammo, Friday dip was their last hail Mary to stop loses on their puts and are forced to close their position. GME begins it's burn to the moon!
  
For this scenario:  

* Shorts are already kind of fucked.  
* Big investment firms have proven many times before that they are arrogant and they can be very wrong.  
* GME is shorted into oblivion and unless it declares bankruptcy in next weeks or months they will HAVE to exit.  
* Any good news will make this only more likely (like new investor reveals that they are getting involved for a long position).  
  
Against this scenario:  

* Like I said before, we don't exactly know what shorts could have up their sleeve.  
* If shorts are replaced by new ones they will not be forced.   
  
How do we know it is happening:  

* Price jumps on Tuesday and continues the trend more slowly later even without short restrictions.  
  
My personal opinion:  

* It's likely and this is my bet. PT: very hard to say but could be anywhere between $60 and $200 or even way more in next weeks or months.   
   
##**Mother of all Short Squeezes**  
   
***We make history***  
It turnes out RC actually is your father. In next few days or weeks he reveals his master plan and shorts are royally fucked. They will sing songs about us.  
   
For this scenario:  

* All of the "good scenarios" fors, but the good news is actually something big RC or GME reveals that sends shorts running for their life. 
  
Against this scenario:  

*  RC signed a document that prohibits him from acquiring more then 20% shares and while float is low compared to shorts, it's not enough for MOASS.
  
How do we know it is happening:  

* Price opens at $200 or $400 and only goes up. Sorry FOMO guys, the rocket missed the Moon is already past Jupiter.  
   
My personal opinion:  
  
* I and many others dream that RC drops a bomb before Tuesday, but I honestly give this maybe 10% chance of happening. PT: a random number between $420.69 and infinity.   
   
##**Dear FOMO guys**  
If you decide that GME hype is not empty and that the Moon is within reach, please buy non leveraged shares. Margin, leverage or options could fuck you up short term even if in the end we win. 
    
##My position:  
254 long shares at $35.90, 205 leveraged shares at $36.48 (most protected down to $23, considering protecting them even more). Don't judge me, I am europoor.
