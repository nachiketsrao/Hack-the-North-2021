Market cap is $45B and their projected 2020 yearly revenue is $750M, so on the high side but not crazy high. While revenue grew 53% y/y, losses grew 213%. y/y. I.e. money is burning faster than they can make it. Even after taking out stock based compensation and looking purely at operating expenses, they lose $141M a quarter. Yet unity is mature company, almost 20 years old. It’s not in the R&D phase/early growth. It already has a >50% share of the mobile and VR gaming markets. Wtf? So they are spending like crazy to try to grow? They actually can afford to. They have zero debt and 1.7B (billion!) in cash, thanks to going public. That cash represents plenty of runway. Yet even in their first quarterly report, they do indicate they continue to grow by acquisition and might issue more shares to fuel that growth.

I’ve been actually been meaning to buy into this stock based on memeness / buy any COVID stock and after today feeling some fomo. But it’s run up over 300% in just three months and now I’m feeling bearish on it. Any thoughts?
