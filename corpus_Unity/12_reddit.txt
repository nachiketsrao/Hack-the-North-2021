As you guys saw with the $SNOW IPO, that stock popped and a lot of people made a lot of money.  

Unity Technologies is having its IPO tomorrow morning at a reasonable $55 a share under the ticker $U.

  
Unity is a cross-platform game creation engine that supports more than 25 different platforms including iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, Linux, Playstation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Apple TV and a bunch of VR platforms.   

  
What a lot of people don't know is that Apple has been working with Unity to get its game engine updated to support building games for Apple Silicon Macs which should start getting released next month.

  
Not only that, but Apple mentioned that Unity is releasing a public version later this year which will natively run on those Apple Silicon Macs as well. 

  
Apple is betting on the Unity game engine for the future, since Apple did say that every one of their Macs will be switched over to using an Apple Silicon chip within the next 2 years. So they need to work with a game engine to get Apple Silicon chip support quickly, and they chose Unity.

  
Here's the play, buy shares in $U as soon as the market opens. Monitor the price like a hawk, try to time the peak, and sell when it starts to look like it's on a downtrend for quick gains.

  
You can keep an eye on $SPY during the pre-market to see if the market, in general, is going up, which will almost guarantee that $U should rise after the bell.

  
The safest bet is to wait a couple of minutes after open to see if it starts trending up and buy-in.  

  
If things don't turn out as you hoped, you can hold the $U shares long-term, as they will grow alongside the growing gaming industry. The stock price should spike when Unity announces its public Apple Silicon game engine later this year. 

  
 What do you guys think?
