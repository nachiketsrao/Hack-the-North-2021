I  made some profit and sold on its early climb after IPO thinking the  growth isn't sustainable, which it was bc it crashed into 70s from $175. After the crash I kept buying here and there but now it seems like its gaining momentum again.

I'm a big VR/AR bull so I naturally like Unity. Although I'm not exactly sure how I should grasp around 30B valuation. I tried to think the valuation should be somewhat similar to Autodesk(60B) since they both serve as a development/blueprint tool one for engineering and other for game/VR. 

Any thoughts on recent movement or company itself?

My position is 40 stocks cost average of $104.
