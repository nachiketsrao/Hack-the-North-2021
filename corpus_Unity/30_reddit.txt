Hello fellow autists, I'm mostly a lurker but I just wanted to clarify a few reasons why this $GME push was so successful and how it can be replicated for more success in the future.

&#x200B;

Ultimately, I believe this approach is repeatable, and normally I wouldn't be so interested in making money, but knowing who it is at the expense of has piqued my interest a bit more than usual.

This can be a scientific method to expropriate wealth from the worst kinds of rich people, and.. well, I do like that very much indeed, so I wanted to share my analysis of this success.

&#x200B;

1) Freedom of decision and debate:

The targeting of GME shorts was a collaborative effort from the /r/WSB mass line. There was not a single centralized voice of authority that identified and mandated that $GME shorts should be targeted with a squeeze. Users smarter than me identified the weakness of the short positions, and a consensus organically emerged among users as the information was processed.

&#x200B;

2) Unity of action:

If one consensus clearly emerges, all members are expected to follow the party line and not deviate from the consensus, or continue propagandizing against it. Instead, they are committed to the decision made by a supermajority of other users.

The solidarity from subreddit users has been impressive. Hundreds of posts encouraging users to not sell and to buy more has forced the shorts into an irretrievable position. They have no choice now but to lose everything, despite coordinated efforts from their partners in the brokerages. We won, not because we had a perfect strategy or decision-making organization, but because we were unified in our action. This is the most important point. We individuals have less money and thereby less market power than the hedge funds. Obviously, the only way we are stronger than the funds is if we are committed to unity of action, even if we weren't the ones who were originally wanting to target GME shorts. I wasn't involved until later in the game, but even I bought in, because I wanted to be part of something greater than myself. Of course, not every single retail investor who bought GME made money, but on the net, the hedge fund lost billions that will be divvied up among the short squeezers.

&#x200B;

3) General organization:  
This was actually the weakest point in the chain and the greatest area that can be improved. A subreddit with 300 new low-quality posts a minute is not quite the best way to arrive at a consensus. I think better voting and discussion systems may be in order to improve this.

&#x200B;

This is me trying to take advantage of the political to make money. This is not me trying to make a political post about which candidate you should support or which economic policy I want in my country. It's simply me talking about applying a method for better organizing the practice of Buying Stocks I Like.

&#x200B;

The principle of democratic centralism (which is a Leninist idea) is very applicable to organizing future short squeezes. Note that I'm not saying we should manipulate the market or try to drive prices up, I'm just saying that if We all decide we like a stock, We should buy it. And if a lot of people are shorting a stock, that can be a good reason to buy it :)
