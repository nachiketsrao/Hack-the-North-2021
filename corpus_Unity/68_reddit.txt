Just a quick analysis of hype stocks part 1: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k8d1gv/just\_a\_quick\_analysis\_of\_hype\_stocks/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k8d1gv/just_a_quick_analysis_of_hype_stocks/)

Here's a look at 2 tech companies: one is Unity software (U) and the other 1 is  Corsair Gaming Inc  (CRSR)

1. These 2 stock looks almost the same

Both of these stocks got a little bit down right after They IPOed. However, They started their hype right after that, with an upward rangy channel

You can see the 4 dips in the channel on the Unity chart and 3 dips in the channel on the Corsair chart

This channel is a prerequisite before the price gets vertical (and you can see the same tendency in the stocks in part 1)

The curve on both of these is 75 EMA. The lower, blue, long diagonal line on both charts is the mean

These 2 stocks are well-known tech companies affiliated with software (Unity), hardware (Corsair), and gaming (both of them). Both have their HQ in the San Francisco bay area. Both are in the industry for a relatively long time (Unity found in 2004), (Corsair found in 1994).

The awareness, highly efficient market environment, and general market's appetite for tech drove these 2 stock to the hype right after their IPOs

So Why am I writing all of this?

Well, this analysis is done to the implication of the upcoming IPO $SEARS (RaughBlaux) [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k1hco2/psa\_until\_they\_ipo\_censor\_the\_words\_oblox\_and\_blx/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k1hco2/psa_until_they_ipo_censor_the_words_oblox_and_blx/)

This is a well-Known software gaming company, that is founded in 2004, released its main product in 2006.  With the real product, great public awareness, $242.2 million, around 4 billion company valuation, and the tech mania that is present on the market in the late 2010's-Early 2020's , This company has the potential to become a hype stock, a kind of a hype stock that would behave like these ones listed above.

The only weakness this stock has is the end of the corona pandemic. Although it is a minor issue in the market since the vaccine and end of the pandemic hopes have already been priced in the general market

A good time to buy? The next day after the stock's IPO

I hope that you can improve your Strategy in identifying and trading hype stocks........
