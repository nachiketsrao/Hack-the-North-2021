"An update on our recent test flight; we landed beautifully, with pilots, planes, andspaceship safe, secure, and in excellent shape â€” the foundation of every successful mission!

The flight did not reach space as we had been planning. After being released from itsmothership, the spaceshipâ€™s onboard computer that monitors the rocket motor lost connection. As designed, this triggered a fail-safe scenario that intentionally halted ignition of the rocket motor. Following this occurrence, our pilots flew back to Spaceport Americaand landed gracefully as usual.

When I joined Virgin Galactic, I was briefed on the safety engineering of our SpaceflightSystem, which is purposely designed to enable our pilots to safely glide back to theSpaceport at any point during the flight profile. Seeing firsthand how our pilots brought Unity in for a picture perfect landing after an off-nominal condition confirmed this approach. I am even more confident that this is the level of safety that consumers will want and will be expecting from us.

As we do with every test flight, we are evaluating all the data, including the root cause assessment of the computer communication loss.

We remain focused on the test flight program we have previously announced, beginning with a repeat of this test flight, which included two pilots and NASA payloads. This will befollowed by another test flight which will include mission specialists in the cabin. Andfollowing that flight, we will have another test flight which will include our founder, Richard Branson."
