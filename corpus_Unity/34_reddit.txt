**Pretext and hypotheticals:**

GameStop goes to +$150 before earnings (No MOASS trigger in this scenario)

GameStop has positive Q4 Earnings (Positive console launches, holiday season)

>From the Q3 earnings report ([https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-third-quarter-results-positive-start-fourth](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-third-quarter-results-positive-start-fourth))  
>  
>" Due to the uncertainty around the duration and evolving impact of COVID-19, the Company is continuing to suspend guidance, however it expects to realize positive comparable store sales results and profitability in the fiscal fourth quarter**.**  For fiscal November 2020, comparable store sales increased 16.5% and total net sales were $791.1 million compared to $747.6 million in fiscal November 2019. "  
>  
>Also something not mentioned but I think could be relevant ([https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&geo=US&q=gamestop%20near%20me](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&geo=US&q=gamestop%20near%20me))  
>  
>Google trend for "gamestop near me" looks positive for holiday season (you can throw in target, bestbuy, etc for comparibles)

Now, market sentiment and technicals support 100% bullish all things gaming, per continued hypothetical

**What stocks will see the gains in the mad dash towards gaming?**

Ill start this retarded discussion by mentioning;

$EA (sports games monopoly)

$ATVI (overwatch porn)

$TTWO (GTA 6 cash cow)

$U (Unity software for VR anime titties)

$RBLX (Kids version of GTA 6, IPO)

$NVDA (all GPUs on GameStop's website still sold out)

$TSLA (When they ever roll out a dedicated GameStop App)

&#x200B;

Honorable mentions while I'm at it - I think golfing stocks ($GOLF $ELY $DS) might be good long holds because golf had an increase in players due to covid (kid in my weekly golf outings says 3x number of highschool tryouts this year) and increase in NBA popularity (nba and golf are hand in hand, plus CHINA DEMAND). If we become rich, we take over the golfing scene. If we don't, hedge funds will always be golfers. Also, NBA Top Shot collectibles (NFT bullshit) are in a crazy demand rn and that just dropped 2-3 months ago.

I am not a financial advisor, I just like the stocks.

Disclosure: I have a couple shares of most of them, but I am 85% in $GME and 10% in AMC (dip, dip, dip-a-delphia)
