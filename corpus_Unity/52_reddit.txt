This will probably get lost in new but fuck it, here goes nothing. 

You boys have got me and several others to redownload reddit. You boys have brought millions of people together for one cause. Sure, itâ€™s a meme cause, but that still counts towards something. 

Current day politics have people at each others throats, people are currently bracing for civil war. Unity is desperately needed in the US. Label me a conspiracy theorist or whatever you want but I have reason to believe this is on purpose. The elites and top wall street investors want people at each otherâ€™s throats. It keeps their money safe. Shit like $GME threatens their power. They want the common man to hate each other so they can keep making money and stay safe.

So whatâ€™s the point of this post? Well I believe that we could potentially change the landscape of US politics. You see how scared the Hedge Fund guys and Robinhood are. You boys have brought everyone on either side of the political spectrum together. You boys have created unity, and itâ€™s important to keep this unity up. This could be the beginning of a shift in power. Apes together strong, itâ€™s time for the 99% to rise up. $GME to the moonðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€. Letâ€™s fucking do this boys.
