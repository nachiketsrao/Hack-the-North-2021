#***Imagine:***

It's Sunday. You get all spiffed up in your Sunday best; your valentine is on her way over. 

You spend the day playing Cyberpunk 2077 on the PS5 you bought from GameStop because you pulled out at $400 with a 470% profit. 

She's feeding you chocolate turtles and cheering you on. It's almost dinner time now. *It's rocket shaped chicken tendies with the home made dippy sauce.* 

You finish your meal, and start heading up to the bedroom for the night cap. **As you walk into a candlelit bedroom with VG logo rose pedals scattered about, you get a twitter notification:**

*"(@virgingalactic): We are happy to announce that our SpaceShipTwo Unity test flight went smoothly and without error. Our pilots are now safely on the ground and we are preparing for our next flight carrying our founder, Richard Branson."*

You proceed to blow the biggest v-day load in history knowing Tuesday is going to be the biggest, wettest, hardest, rocket ship of a green dildo you have ever seen in your life. 


TLDR; 85k worth of shares. I like the stock. This is fictional writing and not financial advice.
