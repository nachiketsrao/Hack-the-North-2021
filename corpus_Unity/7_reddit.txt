**Edit: as of 11:55am CST this stock play is up from 12.96 to 14.16, and still climbing**

**Edit2: currently bid ask spread is over 30$ apart after hours, and the ask is unity’s ipo price lmao**

**Edit3: sold my shares for 14.66 per, which leaves me like 1.50$ per share**

UNITY Bancorp (UNTY) is 100% a buy. Think about it, some senior engineer working from home heard unity is IPOing and wants to get in on it.

After he opens Robinhood he searches up “UNITY” and the first couple results are UBX and a biotech stock, then he sees the ticker “UNTY” and clicks buy.

UNITY bancorps will PUMPPP even people FOMOing like snowflake will pump it.

.

I’ve got shares cause it doesn’t have options but got like 30% of my portfolio in it
