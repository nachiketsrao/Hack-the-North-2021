This is going to be incredibly unpopular, but it needs to be said.


GME has been a spectacular play. I personally made 8.5x on calls which expired last Friday. It still very well may moonshot even higher. I'm fucking proud of everybody who made that happen.


But ever since this sub got credit for squeezing GME, things have turned into a beer-drunk circlejerk. This place used to be a thriving ecosystem of wild ideas with lovely little nuggets of gold sprinkled throughout the greater heap of shit. Nobody thought they controlled anything, nobody thought the guy next to them YOLOing his savings into whatever stock owed them anything. You just told that dude that they'd be jealous of your gang's gains.


Now, this sub is full of people screaming at each other to stay in GME (fine, cool) but also skewering people for entering ANY OTHER FUCKING TRADE (uncool). We're a bunch of fucking degenerates attempting to squeeze blood from any and all stones which might bleed. We take stupid, big risks, and sometimes we get to feast on some beautiful rewards for those leaps of faith.


Nobody owes you concentrating their portfolio in GME. Nobody should pass up another good opportunity for some "apEs tOgETher sTROnk" bullshit unity. We're fucking pirates. We're fucking mercenaries. And if there's one great way to get this sub shut down it's by attempting to ACTUALLY manipulate the market by co-ordinating group activity. We've crossed the line from all finding a stock we like and piling into it out of FOMO to screaming at each other that we need to band together to raise the price. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WILL FUCK THIS SUB. STOP CONFIRMING THE JACKASS CNBC TAKES.


Trade GME. Trade whatever the fuck your screeching, money-grubbing heart tells you is next. Stop trying to control the guy next to you. FUCK.

Edit: For the harsher version not as focused on the beauty of this sub [read this](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/la3bft/emotional_involvement_has_never_been_this_high/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf). The belief that the way to win a trade is to shepherd everyone else’s attention is likely bullshit and certainly toxic. This sub used to expect to lose, which made losses funny and gains extraordinary. The righteousness around the expectation of winning is fucking poison. There’s no crying in baseball, and there’s certainly no fucking crying in WSB.
