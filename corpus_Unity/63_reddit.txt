â€¦ but I can genuinely say, that, in all of my entirety, I cannot say, that I have ever laughed so hard at losing money.

Itâ€™s my first year doing anything at all with stocks and Iâ€™m learning - you retards are hardly helping me understand but itâ€™s good enough for me

The unity and the brotherhoodâ€¦ and the wives of the boyfriends weâ€™ve been jerking off have made this the best experience of 2021

I had tears in my eyes today after the pummelling we took but not because of the beating - because the energy is unwavering with all the memes and retarded posts with charts and graphs that are just full of shit and have nothing to do with stocks, trends or statistics but I donâ€™t give a fuck because theyâ€™re funny as shit

Itâ€™s literally Rock, Paper, Scissors - Diamond Hands, Paper Hands & Hedge Funds.  Iâ€™m so fucking glad Iâ€™m amongst the winning or losing team that gets to call themselves Diamond Hands.

I still believe weâ€™re going to the fakn moon!

HOLD THAT SHIT IN UNTIL THERES SO MUCH PRESSURE IN YOUR ANUS IT COMPRESSES YOUR FECES INTO A GEMSTONE!
