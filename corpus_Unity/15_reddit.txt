Listen up autists, retards, or whatever you want to call yourselves. We as a community need to seriously figure out a way to trick the algos/scrapers. I saw the post about how we made it on various finance/business websites, and many of you guys are either proud or joke about how desperate boomers or Wall Street’ers must be after missing the tech tendies. 
However, they aren’t playing at all. They want to use our collective strength for their profit: front running our trades. In other words, using our beloved community to line their pockets (which are suede, by the way; the type your wife’s boyfriend’s wears when your gambling your life away ;). 
On a more serious note though, I’d like to use this discussion to constructively come up with ideas to not let them profit of our moves then leave us holding the bags. WE CAN DO THIS BOYZ. 

In the name of JPOW,ELON, and the HOLY BRRR, ... TENDIES!

IN TENDIES WE TRUST.
