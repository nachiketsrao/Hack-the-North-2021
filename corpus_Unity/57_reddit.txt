If you came here to stick it to the hedgies, great! But when you start dumping money you can't afford to lose just to bitch out with your paper hands on the first drop of price. YOU ARE DOING THE EXACT OPPOSITE. You are financing the hedgies, you moron! So only BET (not invest) what you can afford to lose and hold tight to your position. That's the only thing that gives us power, unity and strenght! Fuck paper hands!
