First of all let me start of with the fact that this stock literally can’t go tits up cause it’s in space DUH! As someone that’s followed this company Since before its ipo all memeing aside this cabin reveal that they’re planning on 7/28 has been the most discussed thing on their social media for the past month and I’m surprised by the amount of people not talking about it on this sub. Literally every tiny bit of news that comes out of this company rockets it up a good 15% I don’t care if you don’t believe in the company or not I firmly believe that this shit will hit 30 EOW and yes I know I said that shit last week but for real this time. 
Here are some key points I’d like to highlight as to why this will most likely hit 30 soon.
1. Test flight for Unity has already proved the ability to go to space and return to earth safely 
2. They’ve released what the uniforms for crew and passengers will be
3. Spaceport America is already ready for operations 
4. Refundable deposits of 1000$ shows to me and I’m sure many other investors that they’re almost ready to begin operations 
—Now I know I’ve been rambling pretty long here but here’s what I think will rocket this stock 
5. On 7/28 the cabin revel should be the last piece of the puzzle for commercial space flight, we finally get to see the finished product that so many have been waiting for, what else is there than to announce the first flight, especially at a time so close to Richard Branson’s birthday.
I feel that there is more to this reveal, I firmly believe they will announce either when Branson will finally make his trip up, or the start of customs going up. 

TL;DR my opinion is that the 7/28 cabin reveal will also tell us when they will start accepting customers rocketing the stock higher
