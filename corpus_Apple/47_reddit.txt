As many of y'all know $AAPL has been trading sideways for a month now, with other major tech stocks like MSFT and NVDA leaving AAPL in the dust. This honestly leads us to wonder when the next ATH will be, when will $AAPL hit 155, 160? $AAPL reached ATH recently near $151\~ range and seems to be consolidating for now.

While looking at open interests on AAPL options today, I noticed a whopping volume of 210k for 9/17 150c volume. Are the hedgies or MM's blasting $AAPL up to new ATH soon?  Yes even though $AAPL's trading average is 70\~80M shares per day, an influx of 150 ITM calls will create 21M more shares that need to be covered. (Not including the other weeklies 150c's) That's 1/3\~1/4 of the daily average. I strongly believe that if there is a major push to $150 on $AAPL, $AAPL can finally retest ATH.

Thoughts on whether this would be a catalyst to finally pushing $AAPL out of 150\~ range?Not to mention JPOW ending tapering in early 2022: "INFLATION IS TRANSITORY", + iPhone 13 everything seems to be the right environment for $AAPL to finally pop off after consolidating from all that uncertainty.
