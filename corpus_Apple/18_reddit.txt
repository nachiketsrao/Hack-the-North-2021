As some of us have already heard, Chinese property developer Evergrande is in deep shit and owes three hundred billion dollars. Chinese banks, homeowners, and hedge funds invested in Chinese stocks are freaking out right now. In all likelihood, Evergrande will default and get bailed out by the Chinese government. It is believed that the Evergrande default crisis will cause people to panic, take their money out of the Chinese stock market, and put their money into American stocks. This sudden increase in demand for shares of American stocks will likely cause the share prices of American blue chips to rise. I can imagine stocks such as Disney and Apple increasing as a result of investors switching to American stocks. I think the S & P 500 will greatly benefit from the collapse of Evergrande and the resulting panic.
