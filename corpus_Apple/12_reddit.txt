**TLDR**: Not putting odds on it, but *it’s absolutely possible* that Apple buys, invests or partners with GOEV and you never hear from me again because I’m rich as fuck, sipping incredible hulks on a tropical beach somewhere.

For those who want to know how I arrived at that conclusion, here’s a wall of text.

—————

First, I’m going to lay out what we absolutely know to be true about the connections between Apple and Canoo, **then I’m going to speculate. A lot.**

**Please don’t wyl-out and YOLO your entire life savings into anything, ever, but especially don’t do it here.**

With that disclaimer out of the way, I’m gonna give you a few reasons why I YOLO’d a lot of my life savings into GOEV and why I’m reasonably confident I won’t feel like an asshole when all is said and done.

Okay … Because I’ve had this conversation too many fucking times, I have a good sense of the questions people ask when walking down this path. So I’m gonna to try and anticipate and answer them in advance. If you still think I’m delusional after reading through this, hit me in the comments and I’ll try to fill in whatever gaps I can.

Here we go.

**QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:**

**How do we know Apple was really interested in Canoo? Wasn’t that just a rumor?**

* Apple was absolutely interested in Canoo. There’s no question about that at this point, and you should slap anyone who suggests it’s a debate.
* This January 2021 [article from The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev) lays it all out, but I like you guys, so here’s the TLDR:
   * Apple was talking to Canoo because they wanted their patent-pending skateboard.
   * Apple was interested in investing in, or buying them.
   * Canoo didn’t want to sell.
   * Talks fell apart.

**Didn’t Apple ghost Canoo?**

* We don’t know who ghosted who. The article only says “talks fell apart.” But we have enough information to speculate on why they didn’t get a deal done.
   * According to [The latest Verge article](https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22528448/apple-ulrich-kranz-canoo-bmw-electric-car-autonomous), Apple wanted to buy Canoo, but Canoo was like “nah, we’re good”.
   * Wut? Why the fuck would Canoo say no to Apple?
   * We don’t know for sure, but if we assume the execs at Canoo are logical, rational business-people, it would have been some variation of “fuck that, we can make more money if we do it ourselves.”
   * It’s also possible the talks never advanced to the stage of Apple making or discussing the parameters of an offer, but there are a few reasons I find that hard to believe:

1. Apple has $204B IN CASH. There’s no way they would have been “priced out” of buying Canoo if they wanted them bad enough. Canoo’s market cap is $2.3B. Apple could pull that out of the cushions of the lobby couches in Cupertino.
2. This is when smooth brains say, “yeah, see, that proves Apple didn’t want to buy them!”
3. Sure, that’s one way to read it, but if that were true, why did one of the most valuable companies in the history of mankind trip over their multi-hundred-billion dollar dick to hire the dude who co-founded Canoo and created the skateboard to HELP RUN THEIR ENTIRE CAR BUSINESS within weeks of him hitting the market?
4. The most logical answer is: they LOVED the technology he helped to create at Canoo and wanted as much of it as they could get their hands on without getting sued into the abyss, and hiring Kranz allowed them to buy the brain behind the patents, if not the technology itself.
5. At a minimum, they value his expertise and want him to help them create (or refine) something similar to what he created at GOEV.
6. But there’s at least one other reason they may have been so eager to hire Canoo’s former CEO.
7. Because they still want the skateboard, and no one would be better positioned to help them integrate GOEV’s team and technology into Apple’s plans than the guy who co-founded and led the company.

**But Canoo fired the former CEO right? Why would he want to work with them now?**

* Well, he definitely wasn’t fired, but among us CanooBros, the working hypothesis is he was pushed out because GOEV's new CEO Tony Tequila wanted to run the show.
* Now, I’m petty af and wouldn’t want to work with anyone A) named Tony Tequila, or B) who pushed me out of the company I fucking co-founded and built from the ground up.
* But Canoo’s former CEO is the ultimate wrinkle-brain ([seriously, just look at this picture of his galaxy-sized brain cavity](https://images.app.goo.gl/pfNL8UuCZRBT4TCk7)), and assuming he’s more emotionally mature than me — a five year old — then he might realize he could make a metric-fuck-ton of money by swallowing his pride and helping Apple to get a deal done with Canoo.
* Adding fuel to that fire, he still owns at least 1,257,987 shares of GOEV, which is currently worth $12.3M, and would assuredly multiply if a deal between Apple + Canoo got done.
* **Disclaimer**: There could be all kinds of reasons this is a stupid hypothesis, from Apple’s internal corporate policy on self-dealing to laws that preclude this kind of transaction from occurring, but I’m not smart enough to figure that shit out, so if someone drops legit proof that this outcome is an impossibility, I’ll edit for accuracy and clarity.

**SO UR SAYIN APPLE n CANOO MAKE CAR TOGETHER AND APES GIT LAMBOS?**

* No, I am absolutely not saying this is *going* to happen. But *I am* saying “I don’t see why it *couldn’t*.” And if Apple wants to get to market sooner rather than later, it's the most logical platform investment or acquisition they could possibly make.

**ONE QUICK, BUT IMPORTANT SHOT OF HOPIUM**

* In a February 2021 article, [CNBC reported that the Apple car was “designed to operate without a driver.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/apple-and-hyundai-kia-driving-towards-deal-on-apple-car.html)” This, CNBC said, could indicate that the Apple car’s first customers will be food delivery services and self-driving taxi firms — not the general public.
* Why is that important? Because if it's true, [Canoo is literally the best-positioned EV maker in the world](https://twitter.com/canoo/status/1311385584724619265?s=20) to help [Apple create vehicles that address those segments of the market](https://electrek.co/2021/02/22/electric-vehicle-companies-you-may-not-know-canoo/).
