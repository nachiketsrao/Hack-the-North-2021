In their earnings call today, Wish said that they are seeing very unfavorable LTV:CAC ratios (basically spending too much on marketing to acquire new customers). As a result they said they will stop spending on acquiring new customers, instead focusing on increasing engagement among existing customers. If you look at the app downloads and website views, you can get a pretty good idea of when exactly they stopped trying to acquire new customers.

Their app downloads have been on a slow decline but started absolutely plummeting in August - probably right around the time management started panicking. The situation looks particularly bad on the Apple store (which management singled out as challenging, due to their new privacy regulations), where the Wish app has left the Top 400.

To put that into perspective, some shopping apps more popular than Wish right now include Groupon, Sam's Club, and Dollar General.
