How many of us have googled: “how much would 10k invested in AAPL in 1990 be worth today?” (in addition to “how do I get my gf to let her bf peg me?”).

With automation, AI, ML becoming more widely adopted across industries in the decade ahead, and NVDA’s strong grounding in all of the above, I am convinced NVDA will be the AAPL growth story of this generation. Please change my mind.
