1. 25 years ago, Forest Gump debuts.
2. In the film, his Bubba Gump shrimp money is put into Apple.
3. Based on the timeline, Gump could've bought 3% of the company for about $100,000.
4. Today that's worth $73.8 billion, which would make him the 14th richest person in the world today.

Forrest Gump is a testament to long term investing. People since the movie came out always think “I should have bought Apple.” And yet every year, Apple continues to gain value and the same thought occurs.
