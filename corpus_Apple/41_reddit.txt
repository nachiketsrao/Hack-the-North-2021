And, to top it off, the CCP is now discussing scrapping the Variable Interest Entity (VIE) structure through which foreign investors have "invested" in Chinese companies. [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ofexp9/china\_considers\_closing\_loophole\_used\_by\_tech/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ofexp9/china_considers_closing_loophole_used_by_tech/)

(For a primer on the VIE structure and the risks it poses to American and other foreign investors looking to invest in China, see here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kuhibq/wallstreetsbets\_getting\_infiltrated\_by\_ccp/gisa27x/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kuhibq/wallstreetsbets_getting_infiltrated_by_ccp/gisa27x/?context=3) )

Wonder if American and other foreign investors will \*finally\* get the memo with Didi here. If the CCP wanted American and foreign investors to lose the maximum right out of the gate, they could not have timed this move any better. The SEC requires publicly traded companies to disclose substantial risks to the company’s operations or business. Is there any credible evidence to suggest Didi execs were completely unaware the app was at risk of an imminent shutdown when the company filed its 10-K?

Someone lied. It's either the CCP or Didi itself (which, let's be honest, is likely little more than an alter ego for the CCP anyways, given the usual governmental presence required on boards and the like).

This lack of reciprocity cannot continue. The US government cannot and should not let Chinese companies list here unless they meet the same disclosure requirements that American companies meet under the prevailing securities acts and implementing regulations. Foreign investors in China must have access to the Chinese courts to litigate securities fraud actions, just as happens here on the flipside in the US (recall that Huawei/CCP was able to judicially challenge the Trump Administration's proposed ban in American court).

Unless and until that happens, the lesson is clear: stay away from Chinese offerings. The CCP shows once again it has absolutely no qualms about deceiving and pulling the rug on foreign investors. This is definitely part of a larger pattern of the CCP flexing on foreign investors (see here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kptiml/rip\_jack/gi0cl58/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kptiml/rip_jack/gi0cl58/); [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kp3cg3/tsla\_gang\_heavy\_sigh\_of\_relief\_dont\_want\_to\_get/ghuxevt/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kp3cg3/tsla_gang_heavy_sigh_of_relief_dont_want_to_get/ghuxevt/)). The risk is just not worth it.

Edit: oh, right! I forgot to mention all the widespread reverse merger scams that plagued the markets a decade ago: 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_21st-century_Chinese_reverse_mergers

INB4:

1. Enron, Theranos, Your Hometown Deli, Lordstown, et al. Besides the fact Enron was decades ago, it spawned disclosure and accounting laws that American companies now must comply with. But more to the point, with respect to all of these, the US has securities fraud laws to protect investors here; if they've been injured, and lies or fraudulent statements were made, then the offending company can be haled into court to answer for it, \*including\* by foreigners who invested in them. Theranos, like Enron, has even spawned a criminal process in addition to the civil one.

Tell me: do you, as a foreigner, have the right to demand a judicial remedy in Chinese court against the CCP or a SOE for, e.g., fraudulently rugpulling the VIE structure? Do you, as a foreign investor, have the right to hale Luckin Coffee into Chinese court for securities fraud?

There is no reciprocity. And that's the nub of the problem. As a foreign investor in China, you will get burned, and \*there is nothing you can do about it\* (unlike foreign investors here in the US).

2. Ohh, silly person, China wouldn't shoot itself in the foot and injure its standing in the world by bilking foreign investors and taking all their money, leaving them high and dry. Recall the National Security Law and Hong Kong, in violation of a treaty the CCP signed. The CCP more likely envisions itself as Bruce Willis in this scene from Die Hard 4: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHT2zdQT3Ps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHT2zdQT3Ps) . Yes, it injures itself, but it weakens or takes out its foreign competition in the process. The CCP has shown time and again it's more concerned above all else with consolidating its power. It is better to reign in Hell than to serve in Heaven.

Edit

INB4 no. 3: You and this post are racist. It’s racist to point out that either the CCP or Didi is bilking investors here of all ethnicities and creeds? I think not. Moreover, this is a common wumao tactic often used on social media. They’ve learned they can deflect from the CCP’s misdeeds by crying any criticism of the government or enterprise is racist.

Edit edit:
Hell, let’s go even further! Assume I am indeed a racist (I’m not). How does that factually alter, rebut, or contend with the substance of *anything* I’ve said here?

Edit edit edit: 

INB4 no. 4: You can take Chinese companies to Chinese court for securities fraud. All right. Now consider the following: A big reason for this latest Didi fiasco is, the US demanded that Chinese companies comply with typical US disclosure requirements. And this reluctance on China's part to disclose is because of the way the government has permeated the larger companies, so it refuses based on national security grounds. https://www.ft.com/content/feb85200-a7f1-4cab-bc8e-f02cd6fd0590

Given this linkage between the state and enterprise, and given the state's preoccupation with national security, an injured foreign investor likely wouldn't be able to obtain the information in discovery needed to make his case; it would all be withheld in the interests of safeguarding information related to "national security". The courthouse doors may as well be shut given such flimsy process. Not so here in the US, where there is no such outright permeation of the government in publicly-traded companies.

Edit Edit Edit Edit: I do not have a position in Didi--have not bought or sold a single share or contract.

Edit x 5. Here is a good Bogleheads primer/discussion on some of the differences between Chinese VIEs and the usual ADRs via which foreign companies are more usually traded. https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=292674
