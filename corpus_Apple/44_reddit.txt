First-  Last Year on Joe Rogan...Kanye Mentioned that he wanted to make enough money to not just buy back his own music masters....but liberate hundreds of artists from Universal Music Group (thru buying the whole company!) 

&#x200B;

West has already raised his net worth to 6-7billion so far... his stake in the gap and this 10-year deal will change the game.... but how will he get 40+ billion to buy UMG? 

&#x200B;

Lets travel back- thru kanyes sales historically.... 

\- Kanye West has sold: 

o 21 Million albums and 100 million digital downloads world wide

o 2019 Yeezy Sales for Adidas: 1.5 Billion

\- Could Kanye announce a new album to go with the launch of Yeezy Gap?

&#x200B;

I believe Gap is current sandbagging estimates for Yeezy merch- that ugly cotton candy jacket crashed their site at $200.

\*\*\*Big assumption:   .. I will preface that this multi-year analysis assumes that in a couple of years most of the sales will come from mass-produced clothes at lower prices! millions and millions of yeezy shirts/jackets in the $35-75 price range for the masses.....

Quantitative

\- Yeezy projected addition for 2021 Revenue; 1 billion. 2022 Revenue; 2 billion. Making yeezy a conservative 8billion segment for gap

\- Projected Yeezy revenue total 2021-2025; $13.4 Billion. 30% growth after doing 2billion in 2022. 

&#x200B;

\*Attached picture of earnings projections quarterly and yearly- you can make your own price targets. but mine is 8x FY 2022 Earnings. About $70 per share- conservatively in 2 years from now.... A compound annual growth rate of 48%

Hot Take: Kanye will own 100% of Gap Inc In 10 years. And will buy Universal Music Group....
