- EV is the worlds biggest consumer transformation since phones. Huge market that is being forced by 2030-2035. NIO is in the biggest car market in the world, China, and the CCP has invested to save them from bankruptcy in the older days (whether you trust the CCP or not, they have power and can easily push brands or $$ to consumers (NIO has no issue with demand).
-Car design (beautiful especially the new sedan ET7) + Battery swap and battery as a service. Battery swapping is so new (money losing right now, built infrastructure. No other company has innovated this) and they have developed swap stations all across China. Battery as a service lets customers buy a car and lease the battery, so cars are a bit cheaper up front.
-European expansion, mainly Norway. Plans to come to US, but thats long term.
-Best customer service in the world‚Ä¶ Wether its at the NIO houses, or providing a utility vehicle if you ever get stranded, NIO wins.
-Building an ‚ÄúIndustrial Park‚Äù to ramp production to all new levels and have their part manufacturing done right next door.

NIO will take over China, no doubt in my mind. After all, theres a reason it was 90+% of my portfolio with the run from $3.33 to $66. I still hold ~500 shares and a bunch of LEAPS I got May 10th after selling shares. Moon is regardless, NIO is going to help my dad retire (I told him about the moon ride at $7) and myself and siblings to have a nice head start. I‚Äôll throw a üöÄ cuz I know this is WSB ü¶ç

ALSO: WKHS needs more attention and legitimate diamond hands. Naked shorting, 40-60% SI, fundamentals, and an electric fleet contract stolen from them by under the table money (to a 90% hybrid company that doesnt make engines) I don‚Äôt want your support, I want your oath‚Ä¶ we need to send the horse to the moon.
