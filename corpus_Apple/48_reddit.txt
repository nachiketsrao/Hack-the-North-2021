Listen up retards, I know as well as you do that GME is bound to hit $800 next week, and that RKT is literally named rocket. But now it's time to talk about ol' reliable; and I'm not talking about your wife's hitachi. Don't expect any data or charts because that shit is for nerds.

Last year, Apple had a hell of a run. After dipping as low as $53 per share, we saw an amazing growth of nearly 300% when it hit an all-time high of $145.09 in January. Like Tesla, anybody who would have gotten in on Apple this time last year would finally be moving out of their wife's house to give her and her boyfriend some privacy. Unfortunately hindsight is 20/20 and you were too retarded in March of last year. The question is: are you too retarded in March of this year?

Still skeptical? Who cares! AAPL isn't just a high-growth future-valuation tech-stock. They're also a massively successful company with significant cash-flow and are sitting on a mountain of cash. All it takes is one stupid "innovation" like a slightly flatter volume button to catalyst this bitch upwards, and the fake news media is already talking about the iPhone 13 like Moses is bringing it down from a mountain.

Since hitting ATHs in January, AAPL has dropped roughly 20% down to $120 a share. Why? Because lately everyone's worried about stupid boomer shit like "macroeconomics". If you think that all this bearish sentiment isn't going to dissipate come stimmy season and that we aren't going to begin another insane bull market pushing AAPL and other tech to new ATHs this year, then please go buy physical gold and jerk off to Peter Schiff's youtube channel.  In the meantime, stocks only go up....so buy the fucking dip. 

The move: For this play, I like options that go out at least 90 days, preferably a little further. They're dirty cheap for a company like AAPL and you won't get crushed as hard by theta or trying to time the market.

positions:  09/17 $175c, 09/17 $200c

tldr; buy aapl
