What we know. Apple shelved their car project in 2016 to focus on Autonomy development that could be eventually licensed to car manufacturers. Now they have hired Kranz, co-founder of Canoo.

From the very beginning, Canoo vehicles were designed in such a way as to easily accommodate autonomous technology such as LiDAR.

Kranz knows the Canoo vehicles inside and out better than anyone else, now he will have full access to the Apple autonomous program.

My speculation is that with Kranz at Apple, this could make the perfect match to make Canoo vehicles autonomous equipped at launch and compete directly with Tesla.
