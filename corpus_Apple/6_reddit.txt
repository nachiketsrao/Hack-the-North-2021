We are about two hours away from Apple event and it was mentioned that they may announce and BNPL for Apple USA.  With partnerships already in place, I wouldn’t be surprised if they announce it with Affirm or Goldman Sachs.  Their credit card is with a partnership with Goldman Sachs and some early reports were that Apple was going to partner with Goldman for the BNPL service. However, Apple went with Affirm for Apple Canada.

There are several articles so Just google it since if I post a link I’ll probably do it wrong.  

The open interest for GS for this Friday at 410 and 415 is huge.  If the stock runs a little on the news, it will potentially run a lot.  Affirm has a fairly low float so it runs by leaps and bounds like we have all seen in the last month.  I think it’s going to be GS.  They want into the fin tech space and Cramer who is a GS insider made an interesting statement this morning.  He said that he thinks Apple is going to announce BNPL at the event today.  With his connections, I wouldn’t be surprised if he knew something…

I have 1 415 C for Friday (17th).   I don’t have crazy Ape money to risk…just wanted to share my idea and see what you all think.  

Edit:  I went ahead and bought shares at 405.  With a PE of 7.5 this seems like a low risk or the bottom falling out of it.  Financial stocks might do pretty well in the near term anyway.
