I fully expect PLTR to be the next trillion dollar market cap stock. Itâ€™s got Peter Thiel (ROTH IRA gang) and Karp at the helm, two really smart and patriotic guys, who know what theyâ€™re doing. The IBM partnership was huge in expanding the private sector growth, adding almost 3000 to the sales team. Thereâ€™s an ever growing log of government contracts meaning they have steady revenue.

Palantirâ€™s retail investors are also a class of their own and Karp recognizes this as noted in one of his recent interviews. This I think is huge in cultivating an investor base that will buy, hold, and believe for years to come. Itâ€™s currently my largest holding and I only expect to be that way for the foreseeable 5-10 years. I have no intention of letting a single share go no matter how long boomers keeps it down.

Every other day thereâ€™s news of a new or renewed contract. One day it will be too much to ignore. Wall Street has either been too lazy to understand the company or, if they have done the research, theyâ€™re too stupid to act on it. At least Cathie Woods knows what she sees, currently owning over $872M of it...This is going to be her next Tesla call.

Constantly, being bashed by analysts but being scooped up by the same banks? Come on now, once these jamokes are done loading the boat and the upgrades come out its game over.

Karp and Thiel added over $57m in gold and they are pro digital currencies so that's a plus. No debt and \~2.4B cash on hand.

They are aiming to be Skynet...make of that what you will.

On the TA side of things, it's forming higher bases but bases none the less. The longer the base the longer the explosion to the upside. Once this gets hot the lid is coming off and this is gonna blow.

TLDR: I'm stoned so was probably all over the place but Palantir is gonna be the next early Amazon or Apple or Tesla or Microsoft. Endless government contracts and partnerships and an ever growing private contracts list and clients as well. Two patriotic fellas leading the way.

PLTR and Papa Karp to the ðŸŒ™
