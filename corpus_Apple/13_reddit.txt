So this is happening right now, but the G7 summit just unanimously said China is bad news.  They listed out several reasons and China basically said that’s cap and said that they view the United States as having “sinister intentions.”  So like cool, China drama happens all the time right? But here is where it gets interesting, while the G7 shat on them we started moving a navy carrier group into the South China Sea.  Now this is a routine war drill type thing, but it has always increased tensions.  If you remember a few years back China started increasing their claim to this sea by building artificial islands.  After we just condemned them for human rights violations, supported Hong Kong, and recognized them as a threat due to their growing presence; will they take nicely to our navy in waters that they believe are theirs?  When there were just rumors about a trade war apple stock dropped 4% in one afternoon, and since cell technology is the biggest import from China any event would cause large damage to this industry.  As well as Walmart having 80% of their products from China both are almost reliant and shit bricks over 10% tariff. We don’t really recognize these islands and the territorial waters that come with typically sail through them, but not typically at a time like this.  If this provokes a response I think it might drop? Idk i am kinda retarded, but I bet on space etfs before ufo report and made 50% on calls, and that was far more retarded.
