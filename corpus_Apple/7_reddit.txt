WTF is wrong with you? Do you not know what the efficient markets hypothesis is? Delete your portfolio, nephew.

Market crashes are supposed to be catastrophic. Shocking. UNEXPECTED.

If it is expected, it is already priced in.

The meth-ed out cashier at my local McDonalds has known that tapering is coming soon for months now. PRICED IN.

There will be corrections in some valuations, yes. I'm not saying that all valuations are reasonable right now. But why would the whole fucking thing crash? Literally everyone wants to buy the dip. PRICED IN.

You think the market will crash because 14k Reddit geniuses upvoted a post about the market crashing? PRICED IN.

You're telling me you wouldn't go all in on FAANG/FAAMG/FAGMAN if they dipped 20% tomorrow? (For the CLOVtards in the audience, 20% is the minimum dip required for a market correction). I would fucking jizz all up in my brand new Lululemon ABC Slim-Fit Joggers if I could buy Google at $2200 or Apple at $120.

Nobody is smarter than the market. Especially you.

Pull your head out of your ass. Fucking embarrassing.

My advice to you is this: stfu.

Rant over. I will now go back to waiting in vain for Playboi Carti to drop a motherfucking album

TLDR: If everybody's calling for a market crash, it won't crash. Simple as.
