[Apple bought back $80B of stock last year](https://ycharts.com/companies/AAPL/stock_buyback)

Are we supposed to just ignore how much value Apple is returning to shareholders? 

This is why I almost think you can’t go wrong with $AAPL 2023 calls. Your contract is for 100 shares... by expiration, so many shares will be bought back that it is really like a contract for 120 shares. 

For those apes that are new and don’t understand buybacks, it is essentially the opposite of shareholder dilution. Companies purchase shares of their own stock and then “burn” them into thin air. 

What are some other good buyback stocks? I recently learned that 252 companies in S&P are doing buybacks, first time in history that the majority of them are doing so. But I want BIG, steady buybacks for my value LEAPs. 

I’d keep stacking shares and buy long expiration calls whenever apple dips 5%
