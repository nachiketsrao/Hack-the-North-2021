$Wish is fundamentally a very strong company with approx. $2 billion is cash.

Most downloaded e-commerce app in the world for last 3 years. Expected revenue for 2021 is $3.2 billions and revenue is up 75% compared to last year. 

It is on right track and they have moved into logistic and that will help profit margin in the near future. They are employing technologies such as machine learning to help their customer needs and as they wean from the traditional marketing on Facebook, profit margins will improve even more.

With current market value of approx. $6 billion and 2 billion in cash, Enterprise Value is only 1.25 times the expected 2021 revenue.

So why Mr. Market is pricing this e-commerce company at such dirt cheap level? It can’t be because of the fundamentals as company is very strong as indicated above. 

So what’s going on? I think it is due to merciless short sellers attack for past 4 months which has draw down the price from $32 (February 2021) to $8 until last week. With volume increasing, short sellers will have to cover their short positions sooner rather than later and stock price will move to $40 level. 

In my personal opinion just hold on to your stocks as short sellers are grasping the last straw.
