Obviously CLOV has gotten all the attention as of recent. CLOV was up 85% today and had volume over 732M. The reddit army has taken charge and sent CLOV to truly to the moon. 

I want to share what I think is lining up to be the next CLOV... 

Still largely under the radar is Vancouver based WELL Health Technologies (TSX:WELL) which also has significant short interest, strong fundamentals , and billionaire backers. They just completed a $206M acquisition of “MyHealth” now making it the largest private clinic operator in Canada.

Just prior to that, the company recently announced the $372.9M Acquisition of CRH medical which significantly increased WELLs footprint in the US... This is where it gets interesting. Not only did JP Morgan extend there existing credit line to CRH medical by USD$100M to $300M and RBC provide a C$200M secured credit facility for the recent “MyHealth” acquisition. 

But the company legit partnered with Fenwick & West to assist with a NASDAQ IPO in Q4 of this year.... Fenwick client base is Facebook, Amazon, Cisco, and recently COIN... We are on a launch pad waiting to take off. 

Jumping into the charts now... WELL has consolidated for a year while they have exponentially grown the fundamentals of the business. Just recently they blew through every moving average.

On a Weekly it looks like this rally is just getting started.

RSI is still below 60% and heading in the right direction - Stochastics finally hit that oversold zone and have started to aggressively turn bullish.

Today we saw the stock find new support on the 50day SMA for a strong close.

I think it's very likely we see this breakout of its consolidation period tomorrow and find new support above 8.50 which would set it up for a potential Squeeze/Run into new ATH.

The sky is really the limit here as the company approaches $500M in revenue with Positive EBITDA and a NASDAQ IPO on the horizon. I think it has the potential to be 1 of 2 things. 

1. The next CLOV as it has high short interest and all the same if not better fundamentals
2. A smart diversification tool (Geographically & Financially) for everyone that just made Huge gains on CLOV.
