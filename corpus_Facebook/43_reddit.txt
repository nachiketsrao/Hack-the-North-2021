1. Facebook is the only tech giant that hasn't had its earnings multiple expand like a bubble. It's PE is only 32 and PEG is 1.88 at the time of this writing. Most of the other tech giants have earnings multiples that are frothy. AMZN has a PE of 127 and PEG of 3.53.

2. Technically speaking, I know WSB hates crayons, but what you see above is a Bollinger Band Squeeze on the 10 day chart....and it's breaking out to the upside. 

3. FB's income sheet, balance sheet, and cashflow statements show that this beast is very healthy. No debt, a fuckton of cash, and strong earnings growth. I regret not buying and holding this company after they IPO'd in 2012.

TL:DR If you're mad because you've missed out on the tech giant run, don't be mad. Get in on FB with shares or calls (pick your poison) because barring another black swan event, FB will become the next trillion dollar company and exceed $300/share by EOY 2020.

Positions: FB 285c 8/28 x25 @ .47

UPDATE: I closed the above positions on Thursday end of day. Looking at 300c but have to check IV and expirys.

UPDATE 8/26: I called it. My original positions would have been worth 16.00/contract....4000+% gain....IF I held them. FML
