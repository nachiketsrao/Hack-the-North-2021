Facebook's collects the users' data so the engagement algo can use it to learn things about you. Then it must determine what you are most likely to engage with, and it tries to show you that. 

This is self reinforcing on the users behavior. So theoretically, so long as human psychology ***never ever changes*** the way we decide to browse click on things, facebook's business model will last forever...

Their Risks related to product offerings

"*...Substantially all of our revenue is currently generated from third parties advertising on Facebook and Instagram. As is common in the industry, our marketers do not have long-term advertising commitments with us. Many of our marketers spend only a relatively small portion of their overall advertising budget with us. Marketers will not continue to do business with us, or they will reduce the budgets they are willing to commit to us, if we do not deliver ads in an effective manner, or if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate a competitive return relative to other alternatives. We have implemented, and we will continue to implement, changes to our user data practices. Some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively target ads, which has to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. If we are unable to provide marketers with a suitable return on investment, the pricing of our ads may not increase, or may decline, in which case our revenue and financial results may be harmed. Our advertising revenue can also be adversely affected by a number of other factors, including:*

&#x200B;

* *decreases in user engagement, including time spent on      our products;*
* *our inability to continue to increase user access to      and engagement with our products;*
* *product changes or inventory management decisions we      may make that change the size, format, frequency, or relative prominence      of ads displayed on our products or of other unpaid content shared by      marketers on our products;*
* *our inability to maintain or increase marketer demand,      the pricing of our ads, or both*
* *our inability to maintain or increase the quantity or      quality of ads shown to users;*
* *changes to third-party policies that limit our ability      to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of advertising, including      changes by mobile operating system and browser providers such as Apple and      Google;*
* *adverse government actions or legislative, regulatory,      or other legal developments relating to advertising, including      developments that may impact our ability to deliver, target, or measure      the effectiveness of advertising;*
* *user behavior or product changes that may reduce      traffic to features or products that we successfully monetize, including      as a result of increased usage of the Stories format or our messaging      products;*
* *reductions of advertising by marketers due to our      efforts to implement or enforce advertising policies that protect the      security and integrity of our platform;*
* *the availability, accuracy, utility, and security of      analytics and measurement solutions offered by us or third parties that      demonstrate the value of our ads to marketers, or our ability to further      improve such tools;*
* *loss of advertising market share to our competitors,      including if prices to purchase our ads increase or if competitors offer      lower priced, more integrated, or otherwise more effective products;*
* *limitations on our ability to operate material portions      of our business in Europe as a result of European regulators, courts, or      legislative bodies determining that our reliance on SCCs or other legal      bases we rely upon to transfer user data from the European Union to the      United States is invalid;*
* *changes in our marketing and sales or other operations      that we are required to or elect to make as a result of risks related to      complying with foreign laws or regulatory requirements or other government      actions;* 
* *decisions by marketers to reduce their advertising as a      result of adverse media reports or other negative publicity involving us,      our user data practices, our advertising metrics or tools, content on our      products, our efforts to implement or enforce policies relating to content      on our products (including as a result of decisions or recommendations      from the independent Oversight Board), developers with mobile and web      applications that are integrated with our products, or other companies in      our industry;* 
* *reductions of advertising by marketers due to      objectionable content made available on our products by third parties,      questions about our user data practices, concerns about brand safety or      potential legal liability, or uncertainty regarding their own legal and      compliance obligations (for example, a number of marketers announced that      they paused advertising with us in July 2020 due to concerns about content      on our products);* 
* *the effectiveness of our ad targeting or degree to      which users opt out of the use of data for ads, including as a result of      product changes and controls that we have implemented or may implement in      the future in connection with the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, California      Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), other laws, regulations, or regulatory      actions, or otherwise, that impact our ability to use data for advertising      purposes;* 
* *the degree to which users cease or reduce the number of      times they engage with our ads;*
* *changes in the way advertising on mobile devices or on      personal computers is measured or priced;*
* *the success of technologies designed to block the      display of ads or ad measurement tools;* 
* *changes in the composition of our marketer base or our      inability to maintain or grow our marketer base; and* 
* *the impact of macroeconomic conditions, whether in the      advertising industry in general, or among specific types of marketers or      within particular geographies. "*

\-FACEBOOK 10K (01/28/21) ITEM II - RISK FACTORS - quote on pages 15-16 - direct quote

&#x200B;

Overall it seems pretty obvious that their are two major risks...

* loss of users or;
* loss of advertisers

&#x200B;

**The Black Swan Event waiting to happen...**

I believe there is an underestimated 3rd risk factor, where user's deliberately inject false data signals in the form of ad engagement specifically to hurt Facebook in protest... **User Rebellion**. One viral trend that could destroy their ability to monetize.

There is no shortage of reasons for people to hate facebook...if you fall to either side of the political spectrum facebook has done something to piss you off.

If you believe in people's right to privacy, or simply don't think one corp should have a monopoly on everyone's private information. **By and large everyone one hates Facebook for one reason or another.**

&#x200B;

**How hard would it be for users to scare off advertisers?**

But as I discussed above facebook can only monetize ***if they can identify useful data signals for targeted ads and posts.*** So

So how long until facebook users collectively flood them with worthless engagement to deliberately destroy their business?

1. someone posts a video clicking every ad on facebook or instagram, with a catchy hashtag like #DownTheAlgo or #GaslitEngagement

2. other people see it, do the same

3. advertisers see a social media trend that will wipe out their ad budget and they take their money off facebook

4. a "user rebellion" could cripple their ability to monetize and force them to find new revenue streams

People just have to make it clear "if you do business with facebook, you won't get your money's worth"

It's my opinion that facebook is a house of cards, just waiting for a light breeze to knock it down to book value.

**Ethics...**

Since this is obviously an activist stance of sorts, I’ll clearly state how I interpret the ethics of this situation, and why it is “fair game”.  People often judge other’s actions either by their motives, the means they used, or the consequence. Consequence can only be determined after the fact, but to be safe I will cover both motive and means. For one, this isn't me doing it. I am stating a possibility, and if others do it, that is the real cause, because my sharing this risk does not guarantee it comes to fruition. 

&#x200B;

The Motives

&#x200B;

1. Engagement algorithms

a. Trying to manipulate people’s behavior without telling them how, I believe to be the equivalent of running a mass psychological experiment with zero informed consent. This goes against so many ethical guidelines, and just because it’s a AI playing with people’s psychology instead of human’s doesn’t make it any better. 

b. To scare off advertisers all you have to do is make them think everyone is clicking. If facebook didn’t want us to engage with every single ad, they shouldn’t have done such a good job designing it for that exact purpose…

&#x200B;

2. Monopolizing private information and internet speech

a. They have no consistency an due process in an industry that really is many people’s only chance to have a voice.

b. if some viral trend gets people to do this, they are effectively voting Facebook out of business with each click. By design, this only works if the users collectively hit back. 

c. They clearly conned everyone into giving up a valuable resource for free(all your data)…we don’t have to give them a permanent monopoly on it. They are tracking you. You can misdirect their trackers… so game on

&#x200B;

The Means

1. Means must stay above board for anyone who engages

a. This isn’t just a legal thing, it’s strategic. Facebook can tell if you use bots to click every ad and they will ban and that gets the person doing it in trouble

b. However their whole site is designed to get people to engage with ads. So average people…they can’t do anything if they choose to click every ad and by nothing

2. It’s democratic

a. I said above this only works if already active users start flooding them with worthless engagement

b. if some viral trend gets people to do this, they are effectively voting Facebook out of business with each click. By design, this only works if the users collectively hit back. 

3. It’s exactly what their whole platform is designed to make you do…engage with ads. If it can't handle exactly what it was manipulating us to do, that's on them.

a. Totally self explanatory

b. Literally the entire platform exists to make users click on ads…so if clicking on ads to much can cause advertisers to lose value and leave, that’s on them…users were just doing what Facebook tried to manipulate them into doing

Now that I've explained why I see both the motive and means as ethical, I see no reason why people won't engage in such a form of protest. It's easy and it make's sense.

&#x200B;

Disclosure - I've been weighing into puts. I'll be shifting positions going into this trade over the next couple days/weeks. For now I'll say I am/we are short FB. and will update my positions when I've finished entering them.
