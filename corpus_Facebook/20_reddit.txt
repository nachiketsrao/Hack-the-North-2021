Good evening gents. If you’re reading this you’re as retarded as me, and I am excited to present to you the yolo to end all yolos- the tendy time 10x’er. bb fd’s for Facebook earnings.
That’s right you read that correctly, bb fd’s for Facebook. I know what you’re thinking... what does Facebook and bb have to do with each other? Well nothing, but maybe something.
Bb sued Facebook and won- the settlement has not been disclosed(due to NDA’s)nor have we seen any bump in bb cash on hand these ost earnings. Bb is also in negotiation with a “big North American player” for a major patent sale. The details of which are shrouded in secrecy due to NDA’s. 
Put two and two together you have 10 banger easy.
Word on the street is Facebook is the buyer, what a better time to announce such a big transaction than their earnings?
