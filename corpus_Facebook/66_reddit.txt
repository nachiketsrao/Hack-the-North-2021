Imagine co-writing the [New York Times](https://web.archive.org/web/20210127230008/https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/27/business/gamestop-wall-street-bets.html)' biggest piece on class warfare in a decade and completely missing the fact that poor and middle class investors are doing this out of a sense of survival and spite.

Thank you Matt Phillips and Taylor Lorenz for enacting the same level of distain for us as the hedge fundies our tax dollars bailed out after the Great Recession. 

You mischaracterized both the type of people involved in this action (literate, engaged, working poor to middle-class) and the action itself (is it greedy to spend our paychecks wringing dry hedge funds who daily manipulate the markets in milliseconds while we are forced to drop a few bucks here and there and hope for the best?).

There is a palpable elitism at play here, and a deeper concern that rests not with those risking real money during a pandemic for the shot at a better life but for the goddamn MMs and collective arbiters of financial advice and financial institutions beneath whose thumbs we've been placed to squirm long enough. This is a handful of stocks we're using to kneecap some idiot short sellers and you're insinuating that we're about to collapse the whole system. 

We're not. We can't. These motherfuckers can, and have. We're fighting for a piece of the damn pie.

Make up whatever story gets you the headline, "[above the fold](https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1354635872180662273)," as you so deliciously revel in bragging about. I hope you both learn from this. Because you didn't even bother to spend any time here listening to what these working folks have been shouting into every post on the board, shouting on Twitter, on Facebook, into our phones as we watch the stock green dick rocket every hour on Robinhood: "THIS ISN'T ONLY ABOUT THE MONEY!"

HOLD! HOLD! HOLD!
