What do these companies all have in common? Peter Thiel as a founding investor. 

I'm sick of seeing all you dumbasses speculating on how hard it is to find the next TSLA in one thread and complaining about 'bag-holding' PLTR in another.

You retards have unwittingly bought into what the CEO has described will be the 'most important software in the world in a couple years' but are too ADD to sit on a stock for longer than a week.  The fucking DoD gave this company **[800 million dollars](https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/27/palantir-army-contract-dcgs-a/)** over a year ago and they've publicly stated they will never work with China (who by the way the US is about to engage in a tech / data arms race with if they aren't already). 

Gov't contracts aside, public companies are spending 10s of millions of dollars on this software and it's *saving them even more*.  They have essentially been in stealth mode developing their tech for the last 17 years to assure that they have no competition, and the revenue is about to pour in big time. 

Nobody understands this stock yet, and that's beautiful because it has potential to grow 10x in the next 5 years.

Those bags you're complaining about holding are filled with diamonds, institutional investors realized this too late and have been trying to fuck with the price in response.

If you want more in-depth DD, look at [this post by /u/colonel_cubical](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kdp6qr/the_general_public_still_doesnt_understand_pltr/)

TL;DR: Don't be the dumbass that sold TSLA for $50. 

Positions: 50% of my Portfolio in PLTR @ avg. cost of $16.40, bunch of various LEAPs for 2022/2023
