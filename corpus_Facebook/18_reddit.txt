$SKLZ has been consolidating for a \~ week now after breaking up from the \~10 base. I have fair value at a slightly more conservative $18 which is closer to 19 x 2022 expected revenues, with most bullish analyst targets between $20-$30. In a nutshell, there are upcoming game-specific catalysts, increased user growth and retention rates. Risks are ad-spend vs. rev growth, although the next quarterly report is likely to quiet bears based on recent trends and updates.

*\*My* [last DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oh4a15/in_the_city_the_city_of_compton/) *post was $COMP at $13.5 and within 1-2 weeks share price appreciated about 30%.*

**Near-term catalyst for social feature / user growth**

The more specific reason I see for the short-mid term upside is even greater exponential user base increase, stemming from plans to allow friends to player together; think "Facebook + Gambling". They're working out kinks with potential cheating but it seems this feature is just around the corner for the Big Buck Hunter app. This is big for a few reasons:

* Greater organic + referral profits
* Greater organic exposure 
* Greater retention rates (we typically play games longer/more often if our friends are playing them)

Also, one of their top grossing apps, Bowlero, has seen a natural organic search surge over the past \~6 months, indicating growing interest.

**Business Model**

The biz model is largely based on paying entry fees for games, so the more "skilled" you get at these games the more likely you are to spend more $$. Some of the biz model understanding is split between two types of users:

* **Power Users** \- these users are playing daily and spending top percentile entry fees per game, and SKLZ takes a nice cut (as seen above)
* **Noobs** \- users who start with smaller entry fees and start grinding their way up, evolving into Power Users

The addition of playing w/ friends will help evolve noobs into power users. There are also growing incentives/milestones (gamification of gambling games) that help w/ retention rate.

Position (i'm not a higher roller, sorry): 10 x 9/17 13c for short term,  looking for 14 to break and re-test to roll into dec 15c.
