$FBÂ Facebook is confirmed toasted -- Not becos it's monopoly as the media would like you to believe, Methinks it's due to MONEY.

FB may try to hide it, but their intention is crystal clear -- they wanted to control the world with a new global currency > Re: Diem/Libra.

There is no other reason why they must create a currency (now called DIEM backed by USD), they could have just use USD (just like Alipay/Wechat in China). The fact that they keep trying to create some form of digital money on their own means they wanted a global currency controlled by Lizardboy.

>Red line of the Money Boss is very clear: "He who tries to create alternative money shall be BBQed!"

I wouldn't take chances on FB (to moon as a result)... **Put Baby Put.**
