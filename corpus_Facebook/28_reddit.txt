1) Most of you losers are too lazy to switch brokers. Half the ppl on this sub don’t want to go through the hassle of moving funds, selling or transferring stock, and can’t afford account mins with other brokers. Majority of the RH haters will prolly be buying puts on $HOOD through their app lmao. 

2) Their UI is fun, feels like a casino &amp; you get a dopamine rush every time you trade, making you want to do it way too often. All the other mainstream brokers I’ve tried have trash mobile UI. 

3) Hood setup well to make boatloads of cash when Uncle Sammy decides to murdered tether &amp; regulate tf outta cryptidiots. No tether expo. RH also not letting ppl withdrawal coins is right in line with how govt wants things to be. 

4) WSB sentiment has historically been an atrocious indicator of future stock performance. 95% of you losers haven’t been around before the GameStop bs, &amp; don’t remember how terrible WSB is at trading generally. Buying $HOOD is effectively shorting WSB in more ways than one which some might consider to be the best trade of all time. 

TLDR: WSB is too big &amp; still for the most part very bad at trading; Long $HOOD

Current position: 1 share @ $38

Update: 8/4 Tried to warn u autistic retards; short this shit at $77
