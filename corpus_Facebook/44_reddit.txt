1. **Whale Rock Capital - Alex Sacerdote**  
3-year Return: 197.48%  
3-year Annualized Weighted Returns: 43.82%
2. **Crosslink Capital - Seymour Kaufman**  
3-year Return: 186.27%  
3-year Annualized Weighted Returns: 41.99%
3. **Sequoia Capital Global Equities (SCGE) Management - Jeff Wang**  
3-year Return: 171.53%  
3-year Annualized Weighted Returns: 39.51%

Alex Sacerdote is clearly leading the pack; what's even more impressive is that he manages $12 billion dollars, while Kaufman manages $551 million and Wang manages $8.9B. In fact, out of the Top 20 Performing hedge funds, Sacerdote comes in only second to Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management, who has the most assets under management (AUM) of $18 billion.

Whale Rock has a 3-year return of 197.48% as of 3/31/21, and an annualized weighted 3-year return of 43.82%

He has trimmed TSLA, SHOP, PTON, PINS, and CRWD, and has loaded up on AMZN, GOOGL, and FB. No, this isnâ€™t the end of growth stocks, and I am certainly holding on to mine. However, it may be safe to allocate some capital into proven, cash-generating companies. Stay safe everyone!
