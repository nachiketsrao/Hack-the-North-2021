Blackberry filed a lawsuit against Facebook for Patent Infringement. Technology in WhatsApp Messenger appearntly is Blackberry's tech and Facebook wasn't paying any licensing fees to Blackberry. Both parties settled out of count , Blackberry got a judgement against Facebook and a judge in Germany ordered a hault on WhatsApp use of BB technology which could have affected nearly 80 million users. 

Only the patent settlement Facebook and Blackberry reached out of court recently turned into a patent sale. With a large upfront payment and 7 years of IP licensing tail. 

John Chen CEO said in March that BB entered into patent sale negotiation with North America based tech co and can't disclose more. 

I strongly believe that BB and FB are negotiating not just patent sale but also a partnership agreement. Blackberry will secure WhatsApp Messenger for Enterprise. Blackberry gets free advertising on FB Instagram. 

Patent payout upfront 600 million plus 1.4 billion over seven years in IP licensing. 

Facebook wants to get in on the action and partner with Blackberry. After all it's Blackberry who invented the smart phone and the instant messenger. Judges, lawyers and political figures were using Secure Messenger BBM well before anyone else. They were first to market in smart phones and BBM

Mark Zuckerberg was living in the college dorm even Blackberry enterprise customers were already using BBM and it's only fair that Blackberry finally gets fair compensation for their innovative technology. 

John Chen when asked about the patent sale he said stay tuned. He meant there is very good news coming soon. Don't sell your shares. Hold
