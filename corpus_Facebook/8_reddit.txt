Just wanted to do a quick comparison analysis of Blackberry UES Ai Cybersecurity software with other in the same industry. Only other companies that can be compared with Blackberry Ai cybersecurity is Crowdstrike and SentenialOne, both use Ai for cybersecurity BUT they both have older Ai engine that comes nowhere close to BB Ai engine. 

CRWD market cap : $60 Billion ($800 mm annual rev)  
SentenialOne market cap: $17 Billion ( $100 mm annual rev)

BB Blackberry market cap: $6 Billion ($1billion annual rev)

BB is not just leader in cybersecurity protecting 500 million endpoints including 200 million connected cars on the road but they are also providing the foundation for iot platform, QNX secure operating system. The QNX runs the entire medical device industry, drones, and controls over 78% of Ev connected car market. QNX is kinda monopoly with a HUGE moat because it has BB Ai engine embedded to prevent hacks and ransomeware and viruses.

I'm happy that WSB crowd and Apes are holding and brining much needed attention to this stock. This stock was being kicked around by analyst on purpose in hope that the company would go under 5 years ago so they can come buy patents and parts for cheap.

BB holds over 42,000 patents and over 70% of cybersecurity ai patents!!!! They are selling of their old business patents like messaging, phones, networking wireless to likely Facebook. Once it's announced the stock should do 3-4x. 

Not a financial advice but please look into BB. It's not a phone company but a leader in cybersecurity!!! they run iot and cybersecurity world for banks, defense, drones, cars, etc!!
