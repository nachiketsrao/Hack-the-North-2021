# Canada:

It might surprise you but BB is a Canadian company ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ . One thing all Canadian federal parties (LPC, CPC, BQ, NDP, GPC) have in common is ***they heavily support Canadian companies no matter what***. Not only that, people in Canada still reminiscent about BB and their role in Canadian history.

[Here is CEO John Chen at Public Policy Forum in 2019 on why he chose to stay in Canada and the support he got from the federal Canadian Gov. I highly recommend you watch the whole section since it highly speaks of BB's culture. (0:53 - 4:18).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hQQlCWMrQA&t=53s)

# Facebook Settlement:

[Here is Bloomberg reporting in January 2021 that Facebook and BlackBerry has settled with no further details.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/blackberry-and-facebook-are-in-process-of-global-settlement)

`... Should you complete the sale, just the vast majority of your portfolio and you won't have any licensing revenue going forward? ...`

`John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer`

`Well, it's a major portion of our portfolio.`

&#x200B;

2) [Deal involves one huge payment followed by a tail revenue and keeping IVY and QNX(36:53 - 38:09)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQU7MHwJSAs&t=2213s)

`Daniel Chan -- TD Securities -- Analyst`

`Hi, John. Just a question about how you're hoping to structure the deal for the patent sale. Should we expect ongoing royalties to come from, maybe you get a portion of the licensing fees that you are -- that the buyer will take or is this more of a one-time deal?`

`John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer`

`There is a majority of the deal will come in one-time early, but there is a tail that goes on. I can't give you the details of this, but for multiple number of years.`

`Daniel Chan -- TD Securities -- Analyst`

`Okay, now you mentioned in the past that you've had offers for the entire portfolio. So what's different now that's making you consider selling it.`

`John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer`

`There re two reasons. Number one is, I really think it is a wrong thing to sell the entire portfolio because there is so much of our -- we have an ongoing business in cybersecurity and an ongoing business in BTS which of course includes IVY and QNX. I think selling those portfolio will be extremely unwise for the company and for the shareholders.`

&#x200B;

3) [Tail revenue is up to SEVEN years (@47:31).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQU7MHwJSAs&t=2851s)

`John Chen -- Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer`

`Yeah. Paul, that's a good question. So this is an unusual year. So let's talk about, if the patent license goes through, if the sale goes through, we will have -- we will report a one-time gain of a reasonably big number, followed by a tail of up to seven years.`

&#x200B;

All of this is huge. It shows that:

1.	BB is in the upper position in negotiation by the fact that Facebook is willing to buy a majority of BB's patents upright to avoid trial
2.	BB is in the position to negotiate up to 7 years of licensing revenue after their sale.
3.	BB has a clear business plan post sale.
