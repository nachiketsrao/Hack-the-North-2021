**summary for APES**: Blackberry is undervalued by 10x.....it's a leader in cybersec for iot and cars. The BB QNX is the only certified software running on connected and autonomous cars (70% of market)... [here is proof](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-qnx-adds-another-certification-to-its-embedded-software-portfolio-301165498.html)

As you can see there is something going on with blackberry stock. Based on this comparison analysis it's a **massively undervalued** company that's leading charge in EV, iot, connected cars, ai cybersecurity. Rest of these companies only provide a small component of Unified Endpoint Security (UES), only Blackberry provides all components you need for **UES (next gen security architecture)!**! Meaning, an enterprise or government only needs to use a single platform **blackberry spark** to enable UES across their network of iot (computer, laptop, servers, phones, drones, cars, etc). The other companies only provide small part of UES, so it's more expensive for enterprise to go with other companies because then they have to deal with multiple companies to enable UES. Example, crowdstrike only provides Cybersecurity and does not provide Unified Endpoint Management (UEM) or Car operating system. **To enabled smart and connected future you need UES, UEM, Car Operating system and ai security and only blackberry has all these under a single platform!!!!**

**Blackberry Spark has UES and UEM**. No other companies listed in this table provides both solution. 

Blackberry leads in car security and operating system...none of these other companies have car software. 

Blackbery owns 70% of ai cybersecurity patents and has the most advanced and mature machine learning model. the model prevents cyber attacks before they happen...meaning it prevents the attack from executing!! All together blackberry has **40,000 patents**!! 

So at this moment the company's leadership in EV and iot and cybersecurity should value it around 70-80 Billion or at MINIMUM $140 a stock!!

This is just my analysis and DD. Please invest after doing your own DD. This is not a financial advice. 

**Wish you all apes Godspeed**!!! you all have found a true diamond!!
