80%+ of Immunitybio is currently held by its founder/president/global chief science officer Patrick Soon Shiong (owner of la times and part owner of Lakers). Richest doctor in the world and the inventor of Abraxane that was sold to Celgene (which was bought by Bristol Myers Squibb). Abraxane currently does 1.2 billion dollars in sales yearly...

Another 9.5% is owned by the institutions, which increased from 7% just couple months ago. Rest of the float, 10% is owned by retail.

Last financing was done at $12.12 & $9.50, concurrently for $90.7 million... you might wonder who funded it? Patrick Soon Shiong, the billionaire founder himself bought in at $2.62 higher than others.

Immunitybio is currently short 14.6%. PSS never once sold his shares and currently owns 80%+. Institutions have been steadily increasing their stake from 7% to 9.5% (most recent info from fintel). That means short currently have to acquire shares from the remaining shares that retail currently holds, 10%. They are currently short 40% more than the available float.

Catalyst includes, bladder conference on September 10th. BLA submission 2H of 2021. FDA approval in Q1 of 2022.

Their bladder cancer treatment currently has BOTH Fast Track Approval and Break-Through Designation, which they obtained in Phase 1... after meeting their PRIMARY ENDPOINTS EARLY. FYI, they have already met all of their primary and secondary endpoints for phase 2/3, so no need to worry about not hitting it when additional data comes out.

Phase 2/3 Bladder cancer data came out to be 72% COMPLETE REMISSION with very LONG durable remission length. Compare that to the recent horrible data from Fate Therapeutics and Sesen bio's rejection of their BLA submission due to weak data.

Compare that to the current available therapy involving Keytruda at 42% complete remission. IBRX is much higher

Another very promising drug is their pancreatic cancer drug (using triangle defense). Complete remission of 82%. The drug that cured senate majority leader Harry Reid
