Opening Point
Wish is one of the most under appreciated assets in all of commerce. ‚ÄúWish,‚Äù which has almost every unique, weird, and exciting thing to offer. It has a unique feel to it. Similar to Ebay Vs Amazon. Wish allows you to buy UNIQUE items for a discounted price. I think that the product quality, and delivery time will become better for the consumer over the next 12 months based on recent hires, and partnerships. Wish has a decentralized and asset light approach.  Wish is BARELY a household name yet! 

YOU can sell your products in no time on WISH following a general form and business verification.

1)Wish has a data advantage over its piers. 2)Discovery platforms are hard to design. 
3)Wish has over 100M active users.

5) 90% of purchases originate from mobile app. 
6) Merchants gain instant access to 100M+ consumers 
7) Wish Local (local brick and mortar stores are pickup locations for wish products. This is part of their asset light approach. 
8) Wish local gaining transaction. It‚Äôs an extra revenue steam for businesses.

Notable Owners

Peter Thiel owns over 1B in $Wish shares. He is co-founder of PayPal, Palantir, and Founders Fund where he was the first outside investor in Facebook. 

The Downside 
Wish relies on 90% of its sellers coming from China. This becomes a logistical nightmare. Long delivery times and product quality give Wish consumers headaches. 

Closing thoughts. POTENTIAL
IF they address these issues AND diversify the countries their sellers are from (Latin America, Africa, Europe, USA) etc this company looks like it has ALL the potential in the world. It could potentially allow you to sell to the American consumer while being from any country in the world.
