Facebook's hardware division produces Portal (video teleconferencing), Oculus Quest (Virtual Reality), and is working toward Augmented Reality glasses. A precursor to Augmented Reality glasses is coming in 2021 through a partnership with Luxottica (they make Oakley and Ray ban). Each Oculus Quest 2 sold requires an active Facebook account to use the device, and if you delete your Facebook you lose your purchases. The Oculus Quest 2 has been reported to have a production run of 3 million units per year, and it has been backordered by a month since preorders began.

In the consumer hardware space, 3 million units per year isn't huge, but this is somewhere between 50%-100% growth on last years numbers, so it's growing fast. It isn't enough to make Facebook a major hardware producer, but is it enough to put a moat between itself and other social media companies? The major bear case seems to be that social media moves fast and the thing that replaces Facebook could be right around the corner, but how can a social media company replace Facebook if a significant portion of Facebook's userbase eventually needs to maintain an account to operate very endeared hardware?

This is assuming people will be willing to purchase Facebook's hardware. After watching years of Facebook dominating the consumer VR space by pricing superior products at subsidized prices, I'm convinced they can have success even in the face of a vocal adversarial minority.

Edit to add: Breaking into consumer hardware has been difficult and expensive for Facebook, I doubt any other social media company even has the cash, and time to attempt such an endeavor
