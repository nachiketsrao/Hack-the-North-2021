Alright guys Im only going to say this once, so pay attention. 

1. If you’re going to invest in stocks the first thing you need to do is join a Facebook group. 
The people there have already done the homework and know exactly what they’re talking about. 

2. Second, look for post that just have the ticker symbol ex: $abc
That way you know exactly what to buy without doing any hard reading. 
Picking a winner is easy. Just look for the following emojis. 🚀🌕📈👐💎🚂

3. Always, always buy high and sell low. 
Dont bother reading books or looking up quality youtube videos. You didn’t need those economics or finance classes in school, you’re buying a lambo anyway.

4. Then complain about your losses to the same Facebook group because you didn’t know what a stop limit was or when was the right time to pull out. 

5. Become cynical and bitter about any stock, that anyone mentions, but continue to not understand market mechanics.

6. Assume everything is a pump and dump trap. Even though there is evidence to the contrary. #AMC #GME #shortladderattack

If you do these things, you too can be a Facebook group stock investor.

For the record I am not a financial advisor, and this actually terrible advice. But it is the majority of the group and you’re all at one phase of this or another.
