**TL;DR at the bottom.**

Greetings fellow degenerates. I present to you an undervalued, contrarian play that would make Burry proud.

The DD is divided into four parts:

1. ViacomCBS: Company overview, management changes post-merger in 2019, and current digital transformation initiatives (Paramount+ and Pluto TV)
2. Death of a beached whale: Stock blow up.
3. Why VIAC is a fantastic buying opportunity in a severely overbought market: A behemoth trading well below its fair value.
4. My position.

# 1. Overview

ViacomCBS Inc. is an American diversified multinational mass media conglomerate formed through the merger of CBS Corporation and Viacom on December 4, 2019. The company operates over 170 networks and reaches approximately **700 million subscribers in approximately 180 countries, as of 2019.** It comprises of five major units:

&#x200B;

* **CBS Entertainment Group** consists of CBS-branded assets, including the CBS television network, CBS News, CBS Sports, CBS Studios, CBS Media Ventures, Big Ticket Television and CBS Television Stations. The unit also has a 50% interest in The CW television network joint venture co-owned by AT&T subsidiary WarnerMedia through its Warner Bros. division.
* **Domestic Media Networks** encompasses the pay television channels owned by ViacomCBS in the United States, such as MTV, Nickelodeon, Showtime, BET, Comedy  Central, TV Land, Paramount Network, Logo, CMT, Pop TV, Smithsonian Channel, VH1, The Movie Channel, and Flix.      ViacomCBS Domestic also controls production facilities for the channels  listed above, including Nickelodeon Animation Studio.
* **International Networks** encompasses certain international versions of the company's domestic channels, as well as region-specific networks, such as Channel 5 in the United Kingdom, Network 10 in  Australia, and Telefe in Argentina. ViacomCBS International also owns a third of the Rainbow S.r.l. television studio in  Italy, as well as a 49% stake in the Viacom 18 joint venture with TV18.

* **Global Distribution Group** focuses on the global distribution of all programs produced by all ViacomCBS production studios. The division consists of ViacomCBS International Studios.

***Leadership***

ViacomCBS is headed by Robert Bakish.  Bakish holds a Bachelor of Science in operations research from Columbia University's School of Engineering and Applied Science and also earned an MBA from Columbia Business School. He has been with Viacom (per-merger enitiy) since February 1997, joining initially as Vice President of Planning and Development.

**Head of international operations:** In January 2007 Bakish became President of MTV Networks International (MTVNI), overseeing all MTV Networks operations outside the U.S. He immediately restructured MTVNI, cutting 8% of the workforce in addition to merging some overseas units with the UK business and devolving responsibilities for Latin American operations to new offices across the region. He launched the popular Colors franchise of networks via the Viacom18 joint venture in the high-growth market of India. MTVNI had double-digit, year-on-year growth during his tenure.

**CEO:** In January 2011, Bakish was promoted to the newly created position of President and CEO of Viacom International Media Networks (VIMN). During his tenure, Bakish expanded Viacom's international footprint, and VIMN was Viacom's most successful division; revenue doubled, and VIMN grew to more than 200 television channels. Under his leadership, the Paramount Channel was launched, offering movies and television shows in Europe, Latin America and Russia. He oversaw the expansion of networks such as Nickelodeon, Comedy Central and Spike to an increasing number of foreign markets, and helped orchestrate the acquisition of Channel 5 in the UK and Telefe in Argentina. He also oversaw the launch of apps, including the Viacom Play Plex suite of branded mobile TV apps and the BET Play direct-to-consumer subscription video-on-demand app for an adult audience.

In October 2016, Bakish was named acting President and CEO of Viacom effective November 15, replacing interim CEO Tom Dooley. Simultaneously, he was also appointed President and CEO of the newly created Viacom Global Entertainment Group, combining Viacom International Media Networks (VIMN) with Viacom's Music and Entertainment group, which includes MTV, Comedy Central, VH1, Spike TV and Logo TV; two additional networks, TV Land and CMT, also joined the Global Entertainment Group. Optimistic that Bakish could make good on his plans to turn Viacom's core U.S. cable networks and its Paramount Pictures film studio around, the board of directors of Viacom Inc. made Bakish's appointment as President and CEO permanent on December 12, 2016.

In early 2017, **Bakish laid out a five-point plan to turn Viacom around and return the company to steady profitability**. This consisted of focusing on Viacom's six flagship brands: BET, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, Nick Jr. and Paramount; revitalizing content and talent; deepening distributor and advertiser partnerships to **drive traditional revenue; increasing digital offerings, consumer products and live experiences; and optimizing and energizing the organization**. The strategy also included having Paramount Pictures develop films and franchises connected to Viacom television content; additionally, Spike TV would be rebranded as and converted to a broad-based general entertainment channel, the Paramount Network, in early 2018.

By the fall of 2017 Bakish had restructured Viacom, replacing executives at nearly every company, including hiring Jim Gianopulos - formerly chairman and CEO of 20th Century Fox, as the new chairman and CEO of Paramount Pictures.

**In 2018, Bakish's implementation of his five-point comprehensive strategy was credited with Viacom's much improved finances and improved company morale and focus**. In 2018, under Bakish's direction and in accordance with his plan to capture younger and digital markets, Viacom acquired digital platform WhoSay, internet video conference VidCon, and online television network AwesomenessTV. In early 2018, Bakish also announced the launch of an official Viacom streaming service, which will support ads and will include series and content from Viacom that hasn't been available on other streaming services. In April 2018, Viacom launched Viacom Digital Studios, which will create new original content hosted on sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat. In addition, later that June, Bakish announced that Viacom will produce some new series exclusively for Netflix, beginning with Nickelodeon related content.

Post merger, Bakish swiftly started streamlining and managing operating costs, especially during the pandemic. In May 2020, ViacomCBS initiated a round of post-merger layoffs across all parts of the company but primarily hitting divisions within the CBS Entertainment Group. The was part of a restructuring of various operations at CBS as part of the integration with Viacom, as well as nod to changes in the business including those related to COVID. Bakish has targeted $750 million in synergies from the combination and the company said it had eliminated 450 positions. That has risen as the year progressed. “Even before the coronavirus pandemic, we were already in a period of significant change to integrate our newly combined company – work that is helping us weather this crisis, creatively adapt and strengthen the resiliency of our business,” Bakish wrote. “It’s critical that we continue these efforts to integrate and evolve ViacomCBS to remain competitive now and for the future\*\*.  This means continuing to integrate and streamline our operations, manage our costs as diligently as we can, and follow through on our committed post-merger synergy targets.\*\*”

***Current operations and growth driver***

As noted above, one of the largest pay-TV service providers with a diverse portfolio of network subsidiaries, broadcast rights, and content library for all audience demographics. VIAC generates 37% of its Revenue from CBS (primarily CBS and CW Broadcast stations), 34% from Cable Networks (Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, MTV), 11% from Paramount (movie and TV studio), 8% from Showtime, and 7% from Local Media (Owned and Operated affiliates). In terms of the type of revenue, 40% is advertising, 31% is subscription (or affiliate) fees, and 23% is from licensing content.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7pycluoxvsw61.png?width=822&format=png&auto=webp&s=70224b7981b50216a101f302b7fbfa7e3a9e32be

Streaming services are the key growth driver for VIAC. Although, the thesis isn't based on VIAC becoming a streaming powerhouse it's important to discuss where they can easily derive growth to exceed expectations. Currently, they operate two platforms PlutoTV and Paramount+. PlutoTV is a free ad-supported streaming TV service. It currently has 43M monthly active users with a management target of 100-120M by 2024. Paramount+ is a more standard streaming platform ($4.99 for ad-supported and $9.99 for premium). It leverages VIAC's deep content library, news subsidiaries, and is differentiated in its offerings of live sports Overall, streaming revenue is $2.6bn with a management target of $7bn by 2024 with 30M current subscribers and management targets of 65-75M subscribers by 2024.

Paramount+ has a very attractive kid-focused value proposition. This [article](https://www.fatherly.com/play/most-popular-kids-shows/) discusses the most popular kids' shows in 2021 and the top two are unsurprisingly **Paw Patrol and Spongebob Squarepants which are both owned by VIAC.**

Secondly, there is a differentiated live sports offering with VIAC having signed contracts with numerous major sporting events to be hosted on Paramount+. The service will feature **over 1,000 live sporting events per year**, including regular-season games, playoffs, championships and more across the following marquee properties: *The NFL on CBS,* The Masters, NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship, PGA TOUR and Championship, *SEC on CBS,* UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, and UEFA Europa Conference League. **Paramount+ is the only place in the U.S. where soccer fans can find exclusive English-language coverage of every UEFA club competition match, every season.**

Management is aggressively focused on investing in growth initiatives leveraged to streaming platforms that are both subscription-supported and advertising-supported (as seen by their $3bn equity raise in late March. More on this in the next section).

VIAC has great streaming potential with significant differentiating features and **currently the market is not pricing in this potential growth.**

VIAC is unique in operating one of four broadcast networks in the United States. This market position enables broad distribution and large/well-diversified audience demographics. While "cord-cutting" is a key structural challenge, this business generates cash that can be deployed into growth businesses. **Secondly, the return of the theatrical business will serve as another source of both content and cash generation for VIAC as they continue to reposition their portfolio around streaming.**

***Non-core assets***

Non-core assets being sold is another potential source of significant cash. Some would be sale of CBS' headquarter building (\~$1bn), Simon & Schuster (sold for $2.2bn, expected to close in 2021), and CNET $500mn. **All combined this could potentially raise $3.0-3.5bn in cash.**

# 2. Death of a beached whale

As you all probably know by now, our boy Billy Hwang, a 57-year-old veteran investor, managed $10 billion through his private investment firm, Archegos Capital Management. He borrowed billions of dollars from Wall Street banks to build enormous positions in a few American and Chinese stocks.

By the beginning of this year, Mr. Hwang had grown fond of a handful of stocks: ViacomCBS, which had pinned high hopes on its nascent streaming service; Discovery, another media company; and Chinese stocks including the e-cigarette company RLX Technologies and the education company GSX Techedu.

Trading at roughly $12 a little over a year ago, ViacomCBS’s stock rose to about $50 by January. Mr. Hwang kept amassing his stake, through complex positions he arranged with banks called “swaps,” which gave him the economic exposure and returns, but not the actual ownership, of the stock.

By mid-March, as the stock moved toward $100, Mr. Hwang had become the single largest institutional investor in ViacomCBS, according a New York Times analysis of public filings. The people valued the position at $20 billion. But because Archegos’s stake was bolstered by borrowed money, if ViacomCBS shares unexpectedly reversed he would have to pay the banks to cover the losses or be quickly wiped out. On Monday, March 22, ViacomCBS announced plans to sell new shares to the public, a deal that generated $3 billion in new cash to fund its strategic plans (a very preudent decision by management considering the stock price at the time). Morgan Stanley was running the deal. As bankers canvassed the investor community, they were counting on Mr. Hwang to be the anchor investor who would buy at least $300 million of the shares. But sometime between the deal’s announcement and its completion that Wednesday morning, Mr. Hwang changed plans. The reasons aren’t entirely clear, but RLX, the Chinese e-cigarette company, and GSX, the education company, had both spiraled in Asian markets around the same time. Below are the main points of what happened after:

1. Archegos  was hit with a margin call.
2. Archegos  defaulted on their margin call and as a result liquidated their fund
3. The  total value of equity exposure was around $20bn
4. A fire sale began in the stocks that were the underlying security in the total      return swap
5. Banks were forced to sell their position in large block trades

**3.** **Value Opportunity With Incredible Risk/Reward Asymmetry**

A margin of safety is achieved when securities are purchased at prices sufficiently below underlying value to allow for human error, bad luck, or extreme volatility in a complex, unpredictable and rapidly changing world"

\- Seth Klarman, from his book "Margin of Safety"

The opportunity to buy companies with a significant margin of safety is rare in our current stock market environment. However, ViacomCBS presents a unique value opportunity with the stock down over 58% over a one-month period with no material change in the underlying fundamentals of the company.

VIAC reported solid results in the recent Q4-2020 quarter.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2wdq9phowsw61.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&s=1729c4fd605a6eabc47e6f426d76194e658eb07f

While the whole focus is on transitioning the company to streaming, the company is doing it from a position of strength. Yes, the whole playbook revolved around the streaming subscribers.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1ox9ig5qwsw61.png?width=997&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f548399ec1815dfcbe31780f6ca792daf9953be

But VIAC was able to generate that growth while also generating tons of free cash flow.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bzhzoohrwsw61.png?width=690&format=png&auto=webp&s=eede156fcffbce3d1f04fa516e7b724e2636964f

VIAC also repurchased shares at a great price in 2020 and of course used the spike to reissue at a higher price. The proceeds will be used to further bolster Paramount+ and Pluto TV. Netflix achieved its success because of multi-billion-dollar investments in original content, which is a testament to the strong positive correlation between spending on content and subscriber growth. For Paramount+ and Pluto TV to achieve the expected success, ViacomCBS will have to invest substantial amounts in producing high-quality original content and also on securing broadcast rights to live sports events, and it makes sense for the company to raise funds when there is an opportunity in the market. The company has already announced a massive content investment goal through 2024.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s8qi8m8swsw61.png?width=1022&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d42e29734a3745b1598343388bd0f063ab92cfd

Streaming is one of the most competitive, yet fast-growing business segments in the world today. A closer look at recent developments in the industry reveals the presence of a loyal follower base for a brand will not lead to immediate success in the OTT industry. For instance, Apple is struggling to gain market share in the OTT streaming industry although it has a wide follower base and a second-to-none brand value. In contrast, The Walt Disney Company has seen unimaginable success with Disney+. The differentiator is the expertise in content creation and the availability of marketing channels to take the streaming service in front of consumers who are likely to subscribe to a premium subscription service.

ViacomCBS is one of the largest pay-TV service providers in the world, and the company owns some of the most widely followed TV shows and networks. For example, MTV is considered a leading media brand that interacts with the younger population and has a reach of 450 million households in 180 countries. Nickelodeon is another media asset owned by ViacomCBS which has a massive reach. These media assets, the brand value associated with these networks, and the past success of the company in creating content that attracted millions of viewers, will all play an important role in the success story of Paramount+ and Pluto TV.

In 2020, Pluto TV, the ad-supported streaming television service, reported 43 million monthly active users, and I believe MAUs will continue to grow at a stellar pace in the next five years.

&#x200B;

[  Global Pluto TV MAUs](https://preview.redd.it/na560vmtwsw61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b5511fc46880a1046f93209e3b0576874bde7fe)

One of the major hurdles to success faced by the subscription-based OTT content streaming industry in emerging markets is the unwillingness of many consumers to pay a monthly fee to watch premium content. This has a lot to do with the median income levels as well. Because of this characteristic, the illegal pirate video services industry continues to thrive in high-growth regions such as Brazil, India, and many other Asian and Latin American nations. According to a recent study by Mint, India's OTT industry loses up to 30% of revenue to pirate video service providers. Pluto TV is primed for growth in international markets because of its ad-supported model as a result of the favorable demographics for this industry in emerging markets, which will be a catalyst for ViacomCBS's growth in the coming years.

Considering the growth opportunities available in the streaming industry, I believe the company management is correct in raising funds to meet the content investment requirements. As the streaming services gain traction, I am confident of a significant expansion in valuation multiples similar to what happened with Disney stock. As long as Disney remained a traditional media company, the company's shares traded at reasonable valuation multiples. However, the decision to restructure the business last October in a bid to prioritize Disney+ sent the stock soaring to new highs because of the positive sentiment of investors toward the OTT streaming industry. In the coming months, I expect a similar expansion in valuation multiples for ViacomCBS stock as well, along with the steady progress the company is expected to make in prioritizing the direct-to-consumer business.

A little over a year after Viacom and CBS merged, the company showcased an aggressive streaming strategy that includes relaunching CBS All Access as Paramount Plus on March 4, with a content pipeline that combines live sports, breaking news and a massive movie library as well as original films and series for the platform. The company also plans to leverage Pluto TV as a way to attract viewers to Paramount Plus.

“When it comes to streaming, we stand for something unique – an ecosystem of free, pay and premium streaming, underpinned in pay by the new Paramount Plus service,” said CEO Bob Bakish\*\*, adding that ViacomCBS nearly tripled its global streaming subscriber base and more than doubled its streaming subscription revenue over the past two years\*\*. “It’s a streaming service that will resonate with broad and diverse audiences and has a robust slate of originals which will only grow.”

The company had a stronger-than-expected Q4, due in large part to the shift to streaming. The company reached a milestone with global streaming subscribers reaching nearly 30 million across its streaming platforms which include CBS All Access, Showtime OTT and BET Plus\*\*. Domestic streaming subscribers was up 71% to 19.2 million YoY.\*\*

Meanwhile, Pluto TV – which Viacom acquired in early 2019 for $340 million – clinched 43 million global monthly active users and 30.1 million domestic MAUs. **Pluto TV also closed new global distribution agreements with Samsung and Google.**

**Global streaming and digital video revenue increased 71% year-over-year to $888 million in Q4, driven by 74% growth in streaming subscription revenue and 69% streaming advertising revenue growth.**

**Total revenue increased 3% YoY to $6.8 billion in Q4 and the company took in $1.08 billion in operating income. Advertising revenue increased 4% YoY to $3.1 billion in the quarter, mainly due to the growth of streaming and political advertising in Q4.**

Chief Financial Officer Naveen Chopra said ViacomCBS ended 2020 with $2.6 billion in global streaming subscription and advertising revenue – **with an annual run rate of $3.6 billion – exceeding the company’s expectations.** He added that ViacomCBS has a goal of reaching 65 million to 75 million global streaming subscribers – mainly through Paramount Plus – and more than $7 billion in streaming revenue by 2024.

**The new service includes more than 30,000 TV episodes and films such as “The Godfather” and “The Brady Bunch” as well as content from CBS, BET, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, MTV and the Smithsonian Channel.**

**Paramount Plus will also debut original movies, series and documentaries, and ViacomCBS is investing aggressively in content to support the growth of its streaming services. ViacomCBS invested $15 billion on content last year, and streaming content expenses will increase to at least $5 billion by 2024**.

“We came up with the pricing strategy because we wanted to serve the greatest addressable audience – which we thing the two tiers does,” said Tom Ryan, president and CEO of streaming at ViacomCBS, who also co-founded Pluto TV. “Also, the two-tiers allow us to drive both subscription and advertising revenue. The $4.99 tier gives us greater flexibility in how we go to market with distribution partners.”

That lower tier still has a lot more content than CBS All Access had. The $9.99 plan has no ads and also has more live sports – including NFL football, the UEFA Champions League, PGA Tour and more – and breaking news, **both of which the execs said is rare in streaming.**

“Right now, we think those are the best price points to go to market with and they’re clearly very competitive in each of their respective lanes,” Ryan said.

Unlike HBO Max, which announced in December that it would release its slate of films simultaneously in theaters and streaming, ViacomCBS said it is committed to the theatrical experience, though the typical 90-day window before a theatrical release is available to buy or rent will be much shorter. **Major films such as “A Quiet Place Part 2” and “Mission Impossible 7” will be available on Paramount Plus 45 days after hitting theaters.**

The company also remains committed to free ad-supported TV. **Pluto TV is on its way to becoming a billion-dollar business and is the top free ad-supported streaming service in the United States with the largest distribution footprint in AVOD.** By the end of 2024, Pluto TV is expected to have between 100 million and 120 million monthly active users globally.

“Pluto TV hasn’t just proven our skeptics wrong, we pioneered a new category and now we’re one of the free leading television services,” Ryan said. “Our ad partners love Pluto because we offer the best of both worlds – the efficient targeting of digital with the brand building and storytelling of traditional TV.”

Pluto TV helps create a “super funnel” that expands the company’s paid services, Ryan said, in part by featuring pilot episodes or past seasons of a show before a new season airs.

**“Once they’re hooked, we offer a trial subscription for more,” he said. “With Pluto’s free linear experience, we can effortlessly introduce tens of millions of viewers to the amazing content we’ve highlighted.”**

**We see several potential catalysts over the coming weeks and months for VIAC:**

**Paramount+ launch:** After a robust marketing campaign with advertisements on the Super Bowl, The Grammy Awards and NCAA March Madness, we expect Paramount+ to have meaningfully broadened consumer awareness. As a result, we expect strong SVOD subscriber net adds in 1Q21. On a total reported basis (i.e., including Showtime OTT and other DTC services), we estimate VIAC will add 4mn+ global SVOD subscribers in 1Q21 vs. an implied average of 2-3mn per quarter during 2020.

**June pricing change:** In early June, VIAC will debut a $4.99 pricing tier for Paramount+, which will also remove the linear station feeds from the service. At this point, management has indicated they will be able to explore further bundling and distribution agreements, which we view as a potential catalyst to 2021 subscriber growth.

**Improving original content slate:** As production returns across VIAC's studios, we expect the original content slate for both film and television to improve for the company's DTC services, namely Paramount+, and the company's linear networks.

**Improving advertising trends:** As the economy reopens, we believe demand for advertising will continue to recover. With the expanded reach from Pluto TV and Paramount+, we believe VIAC presents advertisers a more holistic offering and the ability to reach all age demos.

**We maintain our Buy rating and 12-month price target of $75 for VIAC.**

Note also that Paramount+ only launched in the quarter on March 3, and has the below % share of new subscribers, **beating Disney+, Hulu and Netflix.**

Also, according to this [article](https://investorplace.com/2021/04/viac-stock-worth-21-percent-more-using-free-cash-flow/) by InvestorPlace:

“Last year, ViacomCBS made $1.891 billion in free cash flow (FCF), according to the company’s earnings release. However, that included a large negative FCF result of -$453 million for Q4 2020. That implies that the FCF for the first 9 months of 2020 was $2.344 billion.

This is why I believe that the Q1 2021 results will show a huge turnaround in FCF. The same thing happened last year.

Back in Q1 2020, FCF was $305 million, a turnaround from Q4 2019 when it was at -$629 million. Fiscal year 2019 ended up with a positive FCF of $826 million, despite the hit during the fourth quarter.

So, this must be a seasonal thing about negative FCF during Q4. In fact, looking at the numbers for Q4 2020 even more closely, it included a total of $388 million in one-time losses on sales of assets. That would have come close to covering most of the -$453 million in FCF during Q4 2020. **This is another reason why I believe that Q1 will show a major turnaround in free cash flow**.”

**Recent Price Targets for VIAC:** Benchmark Firm gives $120, Citi gives $92, Needham gives $80, Goldman Sachs gives $75, BMO Capital gives $70

**My 100K position (all in):**

**TL;DR: VIAC is severely undervalued and could present a fantastic turn around play for 2021. Buy LEAPS or shares.**

&#x200B;

Not financial or investment advice. Just my opinion. I eat crayons for breakfast. Yada, yada, yada..
