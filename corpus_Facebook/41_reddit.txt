We all know that Blackberry and Facebook was in a lawsuit over patents… Facebook settled with Blackberry and as part of that settlement, Blackberry could not disclose the settlement. John Chen (CEO of Blackberry) announced he is in a huge negotiations deal with a North American Company for a large amount of BlackBerry’s patents… The company willing to spend billion(s) on buying patents, would have a large sum of cash floating around. To me this would only make sense for Facebook to want to buy those patents (they lost the lawsuit, might as well own it legally now), and for Facebook to sweeten the deal, to go into business with Blackberry. It would be a win/win for both companies… let me know what you guys think?
