This week clover has lined pockets, however, where it sits now Clover Health just aint as good of a deal anymore. Realistically you won’t go wrong holding CLOV considering it will probably trend upwards - albeit more slowly - throughout the rest of the year. But that’s not what we do here, especially as we watch the feds print money. So, real degens need to find the next big thing. Fortunately it seems like there are a few solid picks swirling around, one of them being WELL health $WELL $WLLYF. 

WELL is one of the top providers of digital health services and is severely underrated considering its insane potential for growth. there are a couple key points making this so appealing. 

#1 Billionaire Investors. 
With direct investment from the 30th richest man in the world, Li Ka-shing, WELL has been buying up the competition with multiple 9-digit Acquisitions this year positioning WELL as the largest operator of digital health clinics in the country. In a space with such high barriers to entry, political power is king like we saw with Clover.

#2 NASDAQ listing. 
WELL recently announced their partnership with renowned law firm Fenwick & West, which helped companies like Facebook, Amazon, Cisco, and Coinbase with their IPOs. This is important because WELL’s equivalents in the US are currently trading at much higher multiples making this a unique opportunity to catch the rocket before it leaves.
