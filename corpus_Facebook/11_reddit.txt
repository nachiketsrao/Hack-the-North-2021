Mortgage broker here. The brokerage I'm with is one of the top in the US. I'm in the top 250 individually. 

Visited the UWM campus last month. From what I've gathered, Mat Ishbia is doing his best to overall the appraisal process. Not sure exactly how but I know the news is coming soon and I got an email today about a Facebook live announcement at Market close Thursday. I don't think it's a coincidence that it's happening ex dividend date.

My guess, virtual zoom appraisals with the borrower and appraiser that allow for turn times in less than a week. Currently in my market, appraisals take 3 weeks+. In other markets, 10+ weeks.

12% of Fannies loans come from UWM. If there is a pilot program for a new appraisal process, UWM will get it first.

Also, without a doubt UWM is the fastest lender I can use. I turn refinances in a week and if the appraisal process was fixed I could turn my purchases just as fast.
