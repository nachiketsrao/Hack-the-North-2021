So 2 big catalysts in recent news.. 

1 being that FB lost a big appeal at the SCOTUS level over a $15 billion class action alleging illegal data gathering. This paired with the increasing likelihood of regulatory hammers coming down is not good for FB.

And 2 being that Trump press people have been saying that he plans on dropping a social media platform soon. IDGAF about how you feel about Trump, were here to make fucking money retards.. and in concluding this I will say PUTS ON FACEBOOK!!!

Edit: so I didnt expect anyone to really even look twice at my post so I didnt post my position but here [FB PUTS](http://imgur.com/a/PIM2bUP)

Also, to the user hating on my Prius, my wife is definitely hotter than any woman you have ever set your paper eye balls on.

Edit 2: I keep seeing a lot of comments saying things like how FB is the biggest in VR, or Instagram, or whatever over company they own, as a reason this company will always be big. Do me a favor, go look at what happened when AT&T was trust busted in 1982. Do a little reading. This sentimwnt of anti-trust is only heating up in recent times. If Facebook were to be busted apart, all those companies would become independent companies again and likely trade under their own new ticker. So yes, its a monster of a company, but its not really much of a monster without them. Just food for thought. Much love retards!
