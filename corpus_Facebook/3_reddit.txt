**Overview**

Medifast is a weight-loss company similar to Weight Watchers, but much more profitable and with better management. The company is an MLM that uses coaches (aka Facebook moms) to sell weight-loss plans. This means they market and ship directly to the customer at retail prices, so margins aren't compressed by third-party distributors/wholesalers. About 90% of coaches started as clients, which is a crazy statistic.  They have about 60,000 coaches and each brings in about $3,500 a quarter.

**Fundamentals** 

Medifast is currently trading at around 2x sales with a PE of around 17. They consistently offer conservative guidance (the main reason for the stock being down 30% from its 52 week high is that they warned the cost of their raw materials may increase due to inflation) but they significantly beat earnings more often than not. Just look at their performance over the last 10 years. My favorite part about this company is that their ROIC, ROA, and ROE have been growing consistently since 2011.  They also pay out a dividend of close to 3% and have grown net profit margins from 12.7% to 15.5% of revenue since the beginning of the year.  The potential upside is 77% according to Yahoo Finance.

**The Play** 

Medifast currently has just under 12M shares outstanding, which means that the stock can move insanely fast with even a small amount of volume. We saw an almost 50% gain in May and we're currently about 33% below the 52 week high.  I don't see the stock going more than 5% below where it currently is given they crushed earnings last quarter and they're repurchasing shares.  The only thing this stock needs to run is volume. A quick reversal here is inevitable even without WSB attention, so get in while you can. 

TL;DR: $MED is insanely undervalued as a debt-free company with a Revenue CAGR of 46% since 2017, not to mention consistent net profit margin growth. There are also only 12M shares outstanding and insiders hold about 5%, so this thing will move quickly with enough volume.
