# Cost and Expenses

They are spending truck loads of money on user acquisition and marketing costs juts like any other early stage e-commerce player. In the long term they expect to spend 40%\~45% of their revenue in this area

&#x200B;

[Expected to be 40&#37;\~45&#37; going forward](https://preview.redd.it/vdxe4acke5471.png?width=393&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5dcbbfe8af527a2dc171ef2febb2a126481c6e9)

# Oppurtunitues Ahead

1. 43% of headcount involved in R&D related activities. Huge opp to drive efficiencies at scale
2. 10,800 wish power users and influencers to market the platform, selected based on their social following, this would heavily propel the customers and merchants growth
3. with covid-19 easing across the world, logistical nightmares would be eased
4. Further scaling of Wish local to bring in more brick and mortar stores on the platform
5. Adding new product categories and higher value products as needed by customers
6. increased spending domestically in US due to monetary easing and stimulus
7. Very solid base of long term customers, look at the chart showing the life time value of the users  from the time they started engaging

# Valuation

WISH , still not profitable with an EBITDA loss for Q1 2020 in the range of -60 million equals \~7% sales.

The company doesn not have any financial debt, has \~ $1.5 to$ 2.0 B in cash.

**Looking at their price to sales multiple, the stock is at a heavy discount compared to its peers**

**As of close today,**

|Platform|Price to sales ratio|
|:-|:-|
|ETSY|11.6|
|SHOP|44.44|
|SFIX (stitchfix)|3.844|
|BABA|5.579|
|Avg. Price to sales of 75 Retail (online) sales, data from A.Damodaran from NYU stern|4.52|
|WISH|**2.861**|

with a modest price to sales multiple of 5x, the stock should be trading at \~$24 to be modestly valued compared to other E-Commerce firms.

***TLDR***

*WISH is an undervalued stock play, heavilty discounted compared to its peers. Any price below \~$15 is a joke.*

*I do not care about short interest, Gamma Squeeze but if it helps then bring it on. There were multiple rumors in the past that it's being acquired by Amazon, e-bay. I see institutional intrest to be coming back into the stock.*

*Not selling a single share (1,000 shares at $10.56 avg) until it hits \~45. Might as well hit 60 if there are more WISHes from here.*

**Positions or ban**
