**Trade Ideas for CRSR**

* **Beginners**

* Purchase shares and set limit order to sell at a favorable price target. See above for analyst and insider price targets.

* **Advanced**

* Purchase as many round lot shares as you deem if stock price is under $35 or average in if more conservative
* When the stock rallies, sell covered calls at a strike above your cost basis and wait for Eagle Tree to unload shares to take profits. If Eagle Tree does not unload shares and your calls are ITM at expiration, then enjoy your profits and buy back on the next dip
* When the stock sells off, sell naked puts or put credit spreads and take profits on rallies
* Track chart and check moving averages for entries and exits
* Rinse and repeat until CRSR establishes support in the 40-50 range. Once this occurs, re-evaluate position
* Consider taking profits on half or all your shares if you see a more favorable exit during larger rallies  

**My Current Position**

* 200 shares @ 28.49 average cost basis
* 5 Put Credit Spreads for 7/16/21 32.5/27.5 for $1.65 average premium
