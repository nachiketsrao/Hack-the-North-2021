Stock: SelectQuote (SLQT)

SelectQuote is the pioneer of the direct-to-consumer model for various types of policies in the insurance space. The company has three primary business segments: SelectQuote Senior, SelectQuote Life and SelectQuote Auto & Home.

Before we start, a few key facts:

* By 2030, all baby boomers will be 65 or older (source: the goddamn US Census)
   * 73 million boomers out in the wild…10K a day.
* Consumer buying will continue to shift away from the traditional face-to-face format as the population continues to have ever increasing access to technology (source: common sense).
   * HOW MANY FACEBOOK POSTS HAVE YOUR BOOMER PARENTS OR GRANDPARENTS POSTED IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS? That’s proof.

[Cool colors with dates. Basically, more boomers.](https://preview.redd.it/rhlwxupkmmh71.png?width=1360&format=png&auto=webp&s=c375402cfe6f22a29de4940750f6b82908b5fbc4)

Why now:

The first thing you probably did was Google who the hell SelectQuote is as you slowly rolled your eyes… all while mouthing the words “boomer” and “value investing” to yourself. Not so fast… Well, the stock is DOWN and DOWN BAD the past week. One of SelectQuotes biggest competitor’s (GoHealth: GOCO) had a less than stellar earnings report, which (in my opinion) falsely tanked the entire market segment, which has presented a great buying opportunity. I actually bought some of them too, but that's not important. That said, when a company loses 50-60% overnight, it kinda makes me want to buy it.

Anyway...

Financial points about SLQT and their previous earnings (source: few various websites that a quick google search of the below will show!)

* Q3 results: +80% revenue growth (SOLID)
   * Senior aspects up 101% YoY (SOLID)
   * $266.9M against expected $262.5M (SOLID)
   * EBITDA up 63% YoY (SOLID)

The ONLY aspect of SLQT’s business that I see as being “BAD” is their auto insurance segment, which dropped 33%. Good, because Boomers shouldn’t drive anyway. Safety first.

Well, what happened? Completely unrelated to last week’s decrease, when the previous totals were announced for the company’s Q3 growth, the company tanked before as well. This company spends money to make money. They also rely almost entirely on the boomers. All other areas of the business are nice, but it’s just noise. Medicare makes the world go round.

To me, the company was a “buy” even back it initially dipped. Now, my interest is absolutely peaked. 

Once the GoHealth debacle went down last week, this company (SLQT) announced earnings will be released on August 25th for Q4 and the cumulative FY.

Note: SelectQuote is trading at just 2.8x EV to Sales and 11.5x FY 2022 adjusted EBITDA. (source: Google). 

I SEE OPPORTUNITY.

Positions: 400 $22.50 calls ; also around 450 shares or something like that across a few different areas. Not important... Not really a high dollar position by me (can see my other failures that I have posted), but I think it could be a good (relatively) low risk play.

I think this goes up off earnings and retraces previous support ranges. From there, you make your own decisions.
