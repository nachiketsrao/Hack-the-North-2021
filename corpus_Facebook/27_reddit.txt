Here are a couple reasons I just imagined that I think are good reasons Netflix is about to fail within 1-7 years. 

1. Netflix leaves investors wondering what’s next this earnings season. In Barb from *shark tank*’s words “I don’t think it’s investable”.

2. What’s next is video games for Netflix and I mean they barely make mediocre content already. They hired that Facebook app guy. Wtf are they going to do Netflix FarmTown??

3. YOLO Puts on Netflix I’m not sure when but soon enough they’re gonna be worth 50% less.
