 Welcome back to another episode of "Can Virtual-Pin1025 Predict the Future?"  
After Friday's action, the conclusion is no, but let's look at the chart and see what's going on.

What happened on Friday:

The first real red day in 2 weeks lost support at the $14.50 USD mark but also had reduced volume. Can't win them all. We should consider this pullback extremely healthy and does not interfere with the overall bull trend as we were exceeding the Bollinger bands for 5 straight trading days. Exceeding the Bollinger bands is considered to be a strong indicator of volatility, and I strongly believe we have more volatility to come. I would also assume traders were taking their anywhere from 60%-100% profits off the table.

We did not bounce back up to the $24-$33 range as I expected on Friday, but again opinions are like assholes. Everyone has one. I believe that range is easily accessible still through this coming trading week.

Signs that make me bearish:  
\-1D chart RSI is still quite high but is reaching back into a healthy range.  
\-Lower volume Friday. But the overall market was low and red so I'm not too concerned.  
\-Gap to be filled on the chart. \~$11.56-12.30. Usually, gaps do get filled on charts but not always in the short term.  
\-Loss of the 14.50 support. On the hourly chart we had a small bounce in that range on Thursday after the massive opening and slightly recovered, a bounce again just after open on Friday but ultimately failed for the rest of the day. This is a volume issue and many taking profits/losses trying to swing trade.  
\-Possibility of reaching $12.10, if that fails next stop is probably \~$11.30

These are the bearish signals that I can find and are important to note but again the overall bull trend still exists on a daily, and when in doubt zoom out is the motto. One bad day does not mean you have a bad life.

Signs that make me bullish:  
\-We ended the day inside the top end of the Bollinger bands and they appear to not be contracting yet on the daily chart.  
\-20 DMA and 50DMA have just crossed. This is called a golden cross and the 200DMA is now beginning to slope upwards.  
\-Large amount of strength in the $13.00 range. If you look back at the hourly chart above where we ended Friday you can see where it is flat in comparison to on Wednesday. This shows strong support in this range and will be a powerful foundation to build a cup and handle formation. This range was also significant in the previous run in January

\-Still a large following and people interested in $BB this weekend across forums, subreddits, and media. #1 ticker on WSB Thursday and Friday.  
\-Largest open interest of stock options is $20 USD.  
\-Put/call ratio still relatively low  
\-Small short shares available (Squeeze is in the realm of possibilities again)  
\-RSI looks healthy on the hourly for a dead cat bounce at open  
\-Currently, one of the best plays technically speaking but also fundamentally for the long term (1-2 years+).  
\-I have confirmation bias because cybersecurity is a massive growth market. If you didn't hear, JBS is the world's largest supplier of beef, and got hacked might actually cause a shortage of beef in the supermarkets or a large squeeze in beef prices. Go long on beef and cybersecurity.  
\-Institutions are still accumulating. Remember, around 48% of BB is owned by institutions and insiders. This is massive. One of the largest companies with large institutional ownership is Microsoft at \~70% or Facebook with an %80. We aren't that far off with a much much lower share count.

If the share price goes down significantly tomorrow I'll post another update, only because if the share price goes down with such a small amount of short shares available I believe this will only be tightening the slingshot further that would rocket $BB's share price to the $30s.

Things that we need to continue to look for:  
\-High volume  
\-Amount of posts and articles about $BB on Reddit, commercial websites, and other forums  
\-News or statements from $BB. One piece of news that's significant could be the catalyst to a moonshot.

This week's price target remains the same as what I wanted on Friday. Anywhere $24-$33USD.

Take care, and stay healthy. Go drink some water, please.
