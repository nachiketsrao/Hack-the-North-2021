* Imagine how surprised was I - that after ordering a wrench set from $WISH app as part of my [earlier DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwt1ro/wish_personal_dd_fair_price_share_target_20/) \[ and brace for this fun fact\] , it came in an Amazon packaged envelope with the rest of my Amazon packages, delivered by Amazon. WOW!
* This delivery confused me to a point of contacting Amazon support to report receiving unsolicited package hinting at a Brush Scam
* After I realized WTF just happened, my brain started to connect the dots  

   * DOT 1) how HUGE Amazon is, and
   * DOT 2) how screwed Amazon is going to get after political bureaucrats are done with it, and
   * DOT 3) who ($WISH, not customers) stand to benefit from this.
