Here I am at home, sipping champagne and laughing at how the market is convincing you that UWMC, America's largest wholesale mortgage lender, is supposed to be at ALL TIME LOWS while the real estate is exploding.

Let's get some facts straight, because it hurts me to see how all of you amateurs are being played by the master poker players of Wall Street.

# Real Estate prices

Home prices are hitting record highs. Record low supply of homes. New listings selling on average in just 18 days, also a record pace. 48% of buyers are confident now is the right time to buy real estate. Where are these people getting the money from, you ask? By taking MORTGAGES! High lumber prices, high copper prices, high home prices? Yup, all that money comes from mortgages. Power to those who buy houses with cash, but most of the people need a mortgage. And guess who is in the mortgage business? You betcha, UWMC.

# RKT's earnings were a dissaster, UWMC's will too

Ummm, did you know Mat Ishibia (the CEO of UWMC) gave an ultimatum about a month ago, that brokers must choose who they want to work with. Either RKT or UWMC. Guess whom they picked?

Listen to the CEO: "*out of my 12000 brokers less than 500 said they were gonna go with them, you will see that in the Q2 numbers*" - [https://twitter.com/RickardBalls/status/1390088528764284935?s=20](https://twitter.com/RickardBalls/status/1390088528764284935?s=20)

# Dividend

I know most of you goofs here do not care about dividend because you are all busy making 100% a week gains, but in the real world, where you actually do get to drive a lambo, consistent predictable income like dividends are a big deal. You see, UWMC pays $0.40 per year for every share you own. This is fixed! It does not matter how much the stock price is. However, what matters is that your dividend yield depends on the price you pay to acquire those shares. Confused? Let me give you an example:

* $0.40 dividend per share / (UWMC at $10 a share) = 4.00% annual dividend yield
* $0.40 dividend per share / (UWMC at $9 a share) = 4.44% annual dividend yield
* $0.40 dividend per share / (UWMC at $8 a share) = 5.00% annual dividend yield
* $0.40 dividend per share / (UWMC at $7 a share) = 5.71% annual dividend yield - **WE ARE HERE!**
* $0.40 dividend per share / (UWMC at $5 a share) = 8.00% annual dividend yield
* $0.40 dividend per share / (UWMC at $3 a share) = 13.33% annual dividend yield
* $0.40 dividend per share / (UWMC at $1 a share) = 40.00% annual dividend yield

Basically, it's a gift from heavens to be able to buy a dividend paying stock at low levels because you are locking in a higher % return. Now some of you smartypants will say, *"don't buy a stock just for the dividend"*, and I agree. In some cases, when the company **does not generate cash flow** they will have trouble paying the dividend and will be forced to cut it. However, **UWMC** has no problem with cash flow, meaning $0.40 dividend per share is here to stay for the foreseeable future.

Fun fact, RKT pays no dividend. Institutions know this. They care about predictable stream of cash a.k.a. dividends. BlackRock knows this, hence why they reported on May 2, owning 11.15% of UWMC's float.

# Russell Index

Remember the Russell index hype? Remember how the price went from $7.63 to $9.62 in a matter of few days?

Well the inclusion story is still pretty much on the table. Russell made a mistake. UWMC is in touch with them and **UWMC is eligible for consideration at the annual review in June 2021**. Yes, that's in about a month from now. Don't believe me? You should.

# Bluffing

The definition of bluffing in poker is - ***betting heavily on a weak hand in order to deceive opponents***. I know what you beginners fear - "*What if my stock goes to zero?*" Do you hear yourself? America's largest wholesale dividend paying mortgage broker soon to join Russell 1000 going to zero? Are you that dumb? Did Wall Street pros managed to fool you that much? Remember bluff stories like:

* **We covered on GME** \- No you did not! The stock ain't going below $100 and it's been months since you covered!
* **AMC is going bankrupt** \- No it's not! It went up 348% since January 2021!
* **UWMC is worthless. You should buy real estate at all time highs, let us buy this shitty dividend paying stock that's going to zero.** \- Are you gonna fall for it again?

# Mathematical pressure

You see, when you deal with single digit stocks like AMC at $2 in January 2021, GME at $5 in August 2020, there is a point at which there is just no meat left. There is only a bone. You can't short stock into an oblivion. There is nothing left to short! You are running a risk.

At some point, the rewards from going long way outweigh the risk of going short on a beaten down stock. Melvin did not understand this concept and that's why he lost billions. Simple as that.

You wanna buy low and sell high. Not short sell low and buy to cover high.
