So apparently I can’t talk about Tesla stock on r/stocks so here we go: 

Hello friends. I'm looking at Tesla's
historic volume trends and it's looking like we've seen a pretty linear downtrend in volume on the year.

What are some key variables that coincide with this? Is this a broader macro trend or TSLA specific?

Is it potentially a breakout target if volume ramps up? Would we be looking for a whale?

Or does the low volume suggest a reduced confidence in sentiment?

Thank you for listening. Hopefully the bot doesn’t delete my post for being to short (not the stock, word count).
