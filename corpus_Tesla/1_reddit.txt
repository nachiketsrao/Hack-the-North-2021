**Possibly the truth:**

"Elon reached out to me and said, **look, I've got a bloody disaster on my hands, will you come and join us?** I joined the company and I checked out where they were at. I remember it vividly. After the first few days at Tesla, I went to see Elon at Space-X on a Friday and **he asked me: What do you think? I said Elon, it's a disaster. You're going to have to start again. He asked everything? I said yes, look, I know how to do this, let me design Model S from scratch. Elon asked: What, you mean nothing (can be saved)? I said if you want the best car, then trust me, it's from scratch. I thought well, he can only fire me, but he didn't, he said do it - and he meant it. He actually trusted me and empowered me to do it and we did do it."** \- Lucid Motors CEO Peter Rawlinson on how he was tasked by Elon Musk to engineer the Tesla Model S.

You can even watch old Tesla's videos from 2011 in which Rawlinson talks with passion about Model S:

Why did Elon lie? **Is he afraid of Rawlinson and Lucid?**
