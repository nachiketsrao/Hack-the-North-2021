Someone commented on a $TMC hype post asking: what does this company even do?

After getting berated by WSB finest short squeezers with:

*‚Äúwe don‚Äôt ask questions here‚Äù*

*‚Äúdo we even care?‚Äù*

*‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs a tech company‚Äù*

*‚Äúthis may be the least important question on a thread I have ever seen‚Äù*

I had to say something.. so I responded *‚Äúmetals or something‚Äù*. I had no fucking idea what this company did either. But it got me researching, and the information I have found not only impresses me but also makes me hopeful for the future.

Regardless, I was already in and you are too, and if you‚Äôre not, here is why you should.

At the end of the day, we‚Äôre here to make money so lets go

2 parts. First, what does this company actually do? Second, why this is the least important question right now.

None of this is financial advice, do your own DD.

I just learned how to read so if there‚Äôs mistakes let me know.

# 

# Part 1. metals or something

Check out the company website. Lots of the information I will present can be found there, including their investor site, and 8K filings.

They have a film on the home page that describes this with moving graphics and cool shit. Pretty dope.

(Auto mod doesn't like the link, but it's metals dot co)

**The problem:** Humans want shiny stuff and tech. Like cars and big buildings, and iphones to hear intelligent people discuss politics on twitter, or if our big brother AMC is worth 1 trillion or 100 trillion dollars. The issue is how much we‚Äôre fucking up our planet to get everyone what they want.

**Solution:** Decarbonizing global energy and transport

What do Teslas, and phones, and tech in general need? You guessed it: Pornhub access.

What‚Äôs the second thing they need? Metals.

Carbon-free systems will take billions of tons of metals to build. And as the population grows, urbanizes, and develops, this also requires‚Ä¶ a fuck ton of metals.

The cleanest resource for critical metals are [Polymetallic nodules](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-020-0027-0)

&#x200B;

These ugly fuckers remind me of what my grandma had growing on her elbow before she preceded to cut it off in front of us and bleed profusely. (Her elbow wasn‚Äôt the only thing scarred)

But these little guys, they bleed money. And I mean profusely.

https://preview.redd.it/q3yodmw8lao71.png?width=552&format=png&auto=webp&s=def610525e2f4887be3908a05f9636c702046ab0

They contain the base metals needed to make **batteries**. Which alone is a $12 Billion industry growing at 8.2% rate. By 2027 it‚Äôs estimated the battery metal market will be worth $20.5 Billion.

TMC‚Äôs main focus is supplying the electric vehicle market with the necessary metals. They do this through **deep sea mining**. They have some pretty neat tech like this thing:

[subsea collector](https://preview.redd.it/47y79v6alao71.jpg?width=850&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4f34d44c47d8aeb948519866613d34ce41c2ee51)

It goes along the ocean surface floor (with minimal disturbance) picking up the rocks, sends them up a tube to a ship vessel, where it gets filtered and then zoomed to shore. At the shore, inside a plant, they burn the nodules and extract the metals through some refining voodoo magic. The company also uses AI to do this the most efficient way possible.

&#x200B;

>The Metals Company now holds rights to exploration contracts granted by the International Seabed Authority via three subsidiaries: Nauru Ocean Resources Inc. (NORI), sponsored by Nauru; Tonga Offshore Mining Ltd. (TOML), sponsored by the Kingdom of [Tonga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiKFYTFJ_kw); and Marawa, sponsored by the Republic of Kiribati.

The NORI area **alone** contains enough metal to potentially supply battery metals for **140 million electric vehicles**. Our studies estimate that the number of polymetallic nodules within our three exploration areas is enough to electrify a **quarter of the world‚Äôs** passenger vehicle fleet (**approx. 280 million EVs**).

To put it into perspective; [Tesla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMimIZJiMp0) is the largest producer of electric vehicles, producing a total of 1.43 million cars as of March 2021.

And $TMC is estimated to be sitting on 280 million cars worth of battery metals.

HOLY MOLY

That‚Äôs a lot of rocks.

Their plant is designed to produce **zero waste** and is run on **clean energy**. In the future they‚Äôre looking to recycle the metals from car batteries  and put the metals back into circulation.

>Our aim is to recycle battery metals in a closed-loop system of rental and redeployment partnerships with like-minded EV and battery manufacturers. This circular supply chain will grow over time and, as the need for new metals decreases, recycled metals will become our primary focus.¬†

&#x200B;

>Our plan is simple and attainable: supply the necessary metals with the least possible impact, building enough metal stock to stop extracting from the planet and enabling society to live off recycled metals.

But Junkyard-Razor74, don‚Äôt we have metals on land that we‚Äôre mining? Why yes but back to the planet thing. We‚Äôre trying to save it right? Rightttt?

[and that's just the beginning for climate spending](https://preview.redd.it/omfc8oxelao71.png?width=743&format=png&auto=webp&s=1678ebb747bb9286258c6558085f31fcce8a605b)

Infrastructure, auto industry, transit, power sector, buildings, innovative technologies. They all need metals. And many of them batteries. This is where the metal company is positioning themselves to bank. The future is green üíµ üíµ üíµ ‚òòÔ∏è‚òòÔ∏è‚òòÔ∏è

[land mining bad, sea mining good](https://preview.redd.it/0c3tkkhhlao71.png?width=974&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdf64c78660dbdf9922ec995a324628087ed2429)

>Using nodules to create EV batteries will generate at least **75% less CO2** than ores from land-based mines.

Cool. So now we‚Äôre on the same page. Electric cars have batteries, batteries need metals, TMC make batteries good for planet.

&#x200B;

# Part 2. why it doesn‚Äôt matter (right now)

Information directly from form [8K](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-048261/) dated 9/15/2021.

DeepGreen Metals and Sustainable Opportunities Acquisition Corporation¬†completed Their business combination and began trading on the NASDAQ under ticker $TMC on Sept 10th, 2021.

In connection with the closing of the transaction, The Metals Company expects to receive approximately **$137.5 million** **in cash** prior to transaction fees, including $27.2 million of proceeds distributed from the trust account after accounting for redemptions and **$110.3** **million** of proceeds from PIPE investors in the private placement.

Sustainable Opportunities Acquisition Corporation acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares in the capital of DeepGreen:

The shareholders and the option holders of DeepGreen became entitled to receive at the Effective Time, in exchange for their DeepGreen Common Shares and options to purchase DeepGreen Common Shares, as applicable, an aggregate of **229,162,651 TMC Common Shares** (which includes TMC Common Shares underlying options).

Each Share is automatically convertible into TMC Common Shares on a one-for-one basis.

Sustainable Opportunities Acquisition Corporation entered into Subscription Agreements with certain investors (the ‚ÄúPIPE Investors‚Äù), pursuant to which the PIPE Investors agreed to purchase an aggregate of **11,030,000 TMC Common Shares** at a purchase price of $10.00 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of **$110,300,000** (the¬†‚ÄúPIPE Financing‚Äù).

Sustainable Opportunities Acquisition Corporation also entered into Subscription Agreements for an aggregate of **22,000,000 Common Shares**, for a purchase price of $10.00 per share and an aggregate purchase price of **$220,000,000** with two investors who defaulted on the Closing Date under the Subscription Agreements. The Company plans to aggressively pursue its available remedies with respect to such investors.

**In summary:** They got cash in the bank. Also, the total number of TMC Common Shares outstanding immediately following the Closing was approximately **224,385,324** comprising

* **203,874,981** TMC Common Shares issued to **DeepGreen shareholders**
* **11,030,000** TMC Common Shares issued in connection with the Closing to the **PIPE Investors** pursuant to the PIPE Financing
* **6,759,000** TMC Common Shares held by the **initial shareholders** (which includes the Sponsor, Rick Gaenzle, Isaac Barchas and Justin Kelly) and‚Ä¶
* **2,721,343** TMC Common Shares held by **public shareholders**, reflecting **redemptions of 27,278,657** Class A ordinary shares.

Here‚Äôs the kicker:

**The Sponsor Group Holders and the DeepGreen Holders** (**203,874,981** TMC Common Shares) also **agreed not to effect any sale** or distribution of certain equity securities of the Company held by them **during the period ending on the earlier of (a) 180 days after the Closing**, subject to certain customary exceptions, and (b) subsequent to the Closing, (x) if the last reported sale price of the TMC Common Shares **equals or exceeds $12.00 per share for any 20 trading days within any 30 consecutive trading days** commencing after the closing.

Can‚Äôt sell them until blah blah blah.

**27,278,657** Class A ordinary shares **redeemed**.

**11,030,000** TMC Common Shares offered and sold to the PIPE Investors are currently **locked up**

WTF is a PIPE investor. See this great DD [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pqexc0/spac_pipes_101_degens_playing_low_float_despacs/).

How many shares did WSB, fintwit, investors, and FOMO gamblers buy?

How many shares are going to/have been exercised? ITM?

How many shares short?

Here‚Äôs some boomer from S3:

So you‚Äôre telling me that around 3.6 million shares have been shorted‚Ä¶ when SUPPOSEDLY the available public float is 2.7 million shares‚Ä¶

What am I missing here, are we all retarded? Did I actually learn how to read?

The short interest data of 3.6 million shares short **seems to be** from when the float was larger, before redemption. Most of them **should‚Äôve** covered. **IF** the short interest is the same then yes, the SI is over 100%+

I don‚Äôt even care about the short interest. It can be 30,000 or 3,000,000.

The public fucking float is **2.7 million shares**. According to the SEC filings and the CEO himself. Take a look: [Listen to the first 1 ¬Ω minutes](https://twitter.com/TDANetwork/status/1438917219732312067?s=20).

How many contracts went in the money from closing above $10 Friday 9/17? 1 million? 1.5 million? Where are these shares going to come from..

With sustained buying pressure, buying volume coming in, this baby gonna blow hard!

# Bonus: Part 3. Technical Dialysis

Check out this flow end of day 9/17/2021

Someone is buying up $6 calls expiring 10/15. Why deep into the money? Possibly to hedge a short. Or possibly to exercise and get this gamma squeeze going. IDK just speculation. Unusual none the less.

&#x200B;

Total flow for the day: Very Bullish

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z2uun580mao71.png?width=1715&format=png&auto=webp&s=449dfc8e746925505b90a8ba7ff4c5adb346f372

Notice we have more calls, more call volume, more call premium.

The top charts are for the whole options flow across the entire day.

Notice on 9/16 we had a ‚ÄúAbove the Ask buy‚Äù at $12.98 per share.

The following day 9/17 we had a buy at $10 per share. The price we needed to stay above. The support came just in time.

&#x200B;

Looks like TMC is trading in a rising channel and we have a gap to fill on the 1 hour above $12.

Ballish!

**TL,DR:** The Metals Company is developing the world‚Äôs largest estimated source of battery metals, with enough nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese to electrify the entire U.S. passenger vehicle fleet. They do this through innovative technology and deep-sea mining, which is healthier for our planet and lucrative for our pockets in the long term.

**TL,DR;TL,DR:** The float is 2.7 million everywhere you look. Confirmed again and again. Shorts + Calls ITM + Social Media Interest + hidden ballish divergence = Not enough shares to go around = Up

Throw it in your portfolio and forget it if you'd like.

Regardless if you like the stock or just here for a quick swing, you are in the right place. You have a company sitting on a gold mine (other metals instead) in a great position to increase their market capitalization and do their part and make the world a bit cleaner.

Godspeed.
