 $HIPO - HIPPO HOLDINGS

Degenerates! Let me introduce you to a company with a cute animal as their mascot. This stock has been shorted so much in the past 2 weeks, and I want to bring some apes or in this case some hippos along for the ride. Full disclosure: I own 2000 shares and am willing to buy more tomorrow before their earnings call on Monday during AHs.

What does the company do? Hippo is a transformative homeowner's insurance company well-positioned to disrupt a $108 billion industry. Legacy insurers will be caught flat-footed in the same way Tesla disrupted the auto industry and Sofi is expected to disrupt the personal finance industry.

The spac was valued at over $6B when it was merged but has been shorted all the way down to $2.95B and the price is now at $5.27 per share as of August 15, 2021. There was zero news for the stock to go down except for being "overvalued". This company is now around half of the market cap since the merger and 50% less than LMND's market cap (Their biggest competitor) but yet HIPO still makes more money. This should be shown in the earnings calling happening on Monday (August 16) during after-hours. On August 13, 2021, the stock was shorted at a 78% volume ratio.

SPAC founders (RTPZ), HIPO exces are not allowed to sell for 2 years unless the price vesting is triggered which are $12.50, $15, and $20. This means if the CEO wants to sell his shares within the next 2 years this stock needs go up 137%. Also the PIPE investors bought in at $10 per share which means they are less likely to sell at almost a 50% loss. I don't know about you guys but less insider selling is good enough for me!

Also every time the stock goes up 50 cents, since the price as of market close on Friday, August 13 ($5.27). I promise I will donate $100 to the Save The Hippo fund. (link not included due to content guidelines)
