I know most people in this sub are either retarded or have their trading accounts monitored by their wife’s boyfriend but I also know a lot of you are bullish on Tesla. For the 🌈🐻 in the chat that think Tesla is just a tech savvy car company, I’m here to show you another reason why you’re more retarded than the guy behind the Wendy’s.

Currently the largest cell producers in the world top out at around 50GWh of cell production a year, they are ramping production to try to meet demand but we all know they wont be able to keep up. Tesla on the other hand knew this long ago and started working towards a solution. If the nazis over in Germany didn’t hold up Giga Berlin so long we’d be a lot further ahead, but regardless a huge battery plant that once ramped will shit out 250GWh of cells per year is almost complete. 

With Tesla’s ability to engineer the perfect “machine that builds the machine” they will have another huge competitive advantage within the EV space. Once this plant is ramped and pushing out cells Tesla will be set up the best by a mile to make it out of this. The only thing bearish about this is that materials will be scarce and will hold back production eventually, but while Tesla is dealing with this and still putting out numbers other auto makers will be struggling to get anything from other suppliers.

Down the road I imaging legacy and others will be buying cells from Tesla as well, this will be a ways down the road as Tesla needs every single cell they can get atm.

TLDR: Tesla will run the automotive market and be making battery’s for your wife’s sex toys 🚀🚀

Edit: all you bears keep downvoting but don’t know enough about anything to actually add to the discussion...💀
