**TLDR: Buy puts on Lucid at open tomorrow.**  


Many of you may have heard of Lucid motors. ‚ÄòThe next Tesla‚Äô Cramer calls it. Maybe that will be true in 10 years, maybe it won‚Äôt be. Cramer certainly wasn't right about Tesla 10 years ago, so is he right now? My pea sized brain can‚Äôt give you an answer to that, what I can tell you however, is how to harness your repressed inner üåàüêª to go from Ramenistan to Tendie Town. 

**What‚Äôs the rundown on Lucid?**  
Lucid recently went public through a merger deal, and in doing so, they raised funding from a ‚ÄòPIPE‚Äô. Pipe (Private Investment in Public Equity) basically means that big banks and hedge funds get the chance to buy into this merger deal at an agreed upon price, often below market price, but are subject to a lockup period.

**So what?**  
This lockup period is set to end tomorrow, which means that 166,666,667 (166 ‚Öî Million shares for those of you who can‚Äôt read) are available to be sold tomorrow. Granted, not all of the holders of them will sell, but a good portion will be sold. Furthermore, PIPE investors have been restricted from hedging their positions in any way, shape or form. This means no buying puts and no shorting shares. Given these PIPE investors bought in at a price of $15, it‚Äôs not unreasonable to expect a lot of them to take profits.   
**Who is in the PIPE?**   
 Some Lucid shareholders (bagholders) will scream that the pipe has fundamental holders, and that they won't sell. Though there are *some* long term holders in it, there are a lot of hedge fund‚Äôs in the mix too. These guys are simply in for a short term play, and will be happy to get out with 33% gains.

**Positions?**   
I am currently long 64 September 17th $20 Puts. If you want to play with fire, buy September 3rd puts. These can multibag, but come with a lot more risk.
