Given that $WISH hv a significant number of Chinese merchants, many investors may be concerned over growing trade tensions between US and China but here’s my take. 

1. Many businesses in US depend on China. We may not be familiar with the names of the many SMEs in US that depends on or benefits from China’s cheaper production costs but we most likely have heard of the big names such as Tesla, Apple, Gillette, Levi’s, Barbie dolls, Ray Bans, Nike, Converse etc and the list goes on and on.
2. Game theory. US is not likely to fuck themselves, their economy and China is not going to fuck themselves either, exiting from such a large market. Both sides are going to suffer the loss of an unprecedented number of jobs and the effect of which is an unimaginable hit in their economies. The best outcome for both cums from co-operation.
3. If for any reason that the size of their genitals matters more to them than their economies and people, we must remember that the rest of world gets fucked as well. This shit could cause a recession that spreads faster than a STD in college, so that’s additional protection (pun fully intended). If all else fails, maybe the UN may just send Samuel L Jackson down as The Negotiator to diffuse the tensions. 
4. With all that being said, if push comes to shove. Imo for a worst case scenario, they may just go into a “you-do-yours, I-do-mine” mindset and maybe China stocks get delisted from US stock exchange. Imagine this: BABA, JD, PDD delisted from US markets. Guess what... $WISH is an American based e-commerce platform. Boom. Mic drop.
