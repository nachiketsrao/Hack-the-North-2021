$BARK bark - cheap as chips

$BARK share price is been suffering from the "deSPACing" effect. Multiple growth verticals, 57% YoY revenue growth guidance; 37% revenue growth expected for next year, buy recommendation by the 3 analysts following it (citigroup, jefferies and cannacord) with a price target 2.11x higher than current prices. However it's valued like dogshit:

My thinking is: meme rally is again just starting, FED is not tapering and delta is gonna persist, omnichannel biz are gonna see a new run and I think we are seeing a new run on gme, amc, tesla and all the other meme names as well.  


And BARK, is crazy cheap right now.
