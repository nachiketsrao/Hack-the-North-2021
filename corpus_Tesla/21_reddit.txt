# Introduction: 

In 2020 about 4 billion people were connected to the Internet and 2,3 billion were considered gamers. These gamers spent approximately USD 160 billion. Now, realize two things, first 3,7 billion still do not have access to the Internet, which makes a lot of potential gamers. Secondly, the market is ultra fragmented which means that no company has a strong position. Just imagine if a company was able to gain a 30% market, share, their revenue would be USD 50 billion, way more than Tesla this year.

In front of you, there is a huge market with lots of little players, now the goal is to find the jewel among them. Just imagine a company that is consistently rated as having the best products in the industry but is still small, which means that it has a lot of potentials. I won't make you guess any longer,  this company is Corsair.

# Gaming is gaining momentum:

A few years ago, gamers were still considered as guys with big glasses, skinny with a big grey t-shirt and dirty hair, playing Minecraft all day long. Now, colleges are starting to create e-sport teams. More important, in July, Sports Illustrated covered the e-sport team Faze. Can you imagine what it means that Sports Illustrated covers e-sports? Now instead of showing the latest “real sport” athletes, Sports Illustrated showed an e-sport team. Another example, of the increasing momentum of e-sport is the rapid growth of Twitch users. There is now has more than 15 DAU (daily active user) of Twitch and Corsair has deals with the 3 most followed athletes on Twitch.

# Gamers are heavy spenders:

Whoever lost a game just because the connection was lagging knows that it is likely the most frustrating experience on earth.

Well, gamers hate it too and therefore tend to always buy the latest products. Hence, in addition to a growing fan base, gamers are spending a lot. Catalysts such as 5G will enable to have a way better connection and therefore related gaming products will see massive sales.

**Now that you know that the gaming industry is a cash machine, why should you Corsair?**

# Why Corsair:

As previously explained the gaming market is particularly fragmented, meaning that no company produces a whole ecosystem and that no company has a decisive market share. Here Corsair has an advantage, it offers a whole array of products. A gamer could buy everything he needs in Corsair and he has a lot of choices with the high-quality product as shown by this poll:

&#x200B;

This quality, in addition to the massive help of deals with well-known gamers, will likely help Corsair becoming the new Nike of gaming. As a customer, you know that it is expensive, but you have so much more style with this product than with others. This competitive advantage will enable Corsair to have a higher margin than the competition.

# Financials:

I will skip financials as it is annoying, a good accountant can show whatever he wants so I will sum up for you. Debt has been reduced by 16% this year and at the same time, cash has been increasing. The generation of free cash flow will be used to further reduce debt and hence reduce the cost of debt ( the bond rating jumped from B2 to B1). Being positive free-cash-flow is a huge difference compared to numerous competitors who still lose money and are therefore not self-sustaining.

TLDR: The gaming industry is a great market due to the number of customers and the continuous demand for new products. Moreover, gaming is getting more popular, so more people will play and they will also spend more. Then, concerning the good pick, Corsair is a high-quality company with great margins and generates free cash flow! This is the beginning of an epic journey, take the ride or watch the rocket taking off.

PS: I own shares worth approximately 10’000 USD of Corsair.
