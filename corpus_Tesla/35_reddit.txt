Only really writing this so I can screenshot this post in a year’s time when this stock has already doubled off it’s bottom with no signs of slowing down. The stock I’m talking about is COIN (Coinbase)

COIN is so undervalued it’s insane. It has a 30 PE ratio while literally 11x revenue YoY when corn halved from it’s May peak. It’s priced like fucking AAPL or FB who are growing 30-50% YoY not fucking **tentupling**. Not to mention during the quarter where corn halved from its peak, they increased their profit by 4900% year over year, so the bear argument “if corn drops they’ll stop making money” has already been disproven.  

In terms of financials, COIN is literally the fastest growing stock I have ever seen. Let’s take a quick look 

—-

**Q2 Earnings:**

Revenue: $2.23 billion (up 1097% YoY)

EPS: $3.45/share 

Net Income: $1.61 billion (up 4880% YoY)

Cash on hand: $4.4 billion

**Bear Arguments**

*Growth will slow down*

Obviously growth is going to slow down, but there has been no big tech companies that we see today (the FAANGs) that has grown nearly as fast it this is. They have so much money, they don’t know to do with it. Their profit margins are exceptional on that kind of revenue and even if growth halves, they’ll still be making an absolute metric fuck ton of pure revenue and profit. 


*Their money is dependent on transaction fees*

For now, but they’re branching out. This is a brand new company we’re talking about. I literally know somebody personally who had their company acquired by Coinbase. They’re spreading their roots to more revenue streams so they’re not entirely dependent on transaction fees. Not to mention they already have Coinbase Pro, so people who want low fees can already get them. 


*What if Corn drops*

Corn halved last quarter and they still saw enormous revenue and profits. The *only* reason why I think this could be a problem is if you think corn will flat out stop existing. Corn could drop to 10,000 and as long as people still trade the currency, COIN will be making money


*Competition*

That’s the bear argument to every single superior product. It’s a non-issue. Tesla has competition. Apple has competition. The market is big enough for multiple exchanges. Coinbase ranks up there as one of the best; literally the only better alternative (having a physical wallet) is so inconvenient that nobody in that community does it. The only thing bears can say is “fees” but it’s obvious they have absolutely no idea what they’re talking about and have never even used the app, because if they did, they’d know that Coinbase Pro exists and their fees are almost non-existent.

Plan is to average down if it gets back down to ~$220/share. Willing to add about another $1000 to this play and eyeing October calls
