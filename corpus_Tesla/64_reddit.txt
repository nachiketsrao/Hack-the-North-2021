Basically the community is revolting against their proposed lithium mine, commissioners had an emergency vote Friday and they passed a 60 day stop on PLL operations.  I live near there and can confirm this isn't looking good for them.  For some reason this hasn't been news and their stock is still rising but Tesla isn't going to be buying shit from them for years at this pace.  

Stacking up on PUTS!
