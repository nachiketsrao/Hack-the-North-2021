Lordstown Motors (RIDE) is scheduled to report today after market close.  Things have not been looking good but I believe things are about to look up for them.  Here’s why:

Stock is at at an all time low after a slew of bad press.  Expectations are low but upside is huge if they report presales and continue to remain on track for production next month. 

If their production schedule remains unchanged (which they continue to say they are on track) then they might be the first to market with an electric truck.  Tesla’s cyber truck was just delayed to 2022 and the only other player promising a truck by end of this year that I can see is Rivian (who have already announced delays from their original July dates so who knows). 

The shorts have taken pretty outrageous positions.  At last check they were over 28% of float and rising.  

I am personally expecting all of these factors to lead to a massive breakout by end of today.

TLDR- can’t get much lower, most likely first to market ev truck,  shorts over 28% so fuck em.

FYI - I am not a financial advisor and at best I’m a novice investor who pays attention.  Good luck and may we all get some tendies.
