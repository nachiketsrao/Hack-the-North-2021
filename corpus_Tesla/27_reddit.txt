Many of you are DD writers and all of you are DD readers. We all know how the typical DD goes:

> Stock XYZ has been trading sideways but in D days their P patent will be approved and... 

> They have great fundamentals and have John Doe as their CEO. With experienced leadership, they could...

> XYZ has had solid customer acquisition growth in the past year, and it's only now beginning to show up in these results. This will alert investors that XYZ is...


This kind of talk is usually the majority of every DD post. However, this purely traditional way of doing due diligence is simply not enough for a truly transcendental DD. 

There are millions of Wallstreet traders every day looking at companies. Someone is always going to have more financial experience in this space than you. To actually make a successful play need to have *individual insight*. Something that *you know* that the rest of Wallstreet does not. This is what actually makes great DD's more than anything else.

**What is II (individual insight)**? It's an intuitive understanding of the world that *you have*, but that most other people do not. 

You have this knowledge about *how something really is* that the majority does not already know. This is the foundation of a profitable strategy.

&nbsp;

Examples (from worst to best):

1. 
         
  > **II:** My uncle has a Tesla and I got to ride in it. It was super fast, EV's really are the real deal. TSLA & GOEV 🚀🚀🚀

  Even something as simple and 🦍🧠'd as this counts. This person had an experience that many investors still would not have had, and thus has some personal intuition about the EV space that is uncommon. The reason this is the *worst* example here, is because most people already know how great EVs are, but it still counts.

2. 
         
  > **II:** I'm a Type 1 Diabetic and have recently tried a new glucose monitoring product from SENS. This was a huge improvement to my life, SENS all the way!

  This II is even better and it's obvious why. Far fewer people are Type 1 Diabetics, and it's not even an experience that can be attained by the layman. As strange as it sounds to say, this person was *born* with this individual insight.

3. 
         
  > **II:** I worked for a pool cleaning company for 30 years. Therefore, I know how important Chlorine is for maintaining a healthy pool. Because of the recent shortage of Chlorine, and the need to clean pools, Chlorine alternatives such as saltwater will have increased buying pressure. $HAYW pool equipment company controls the production of these alternatives.

  *Niche jobs* like working for a pool company is going to give this person insight that few other people have. **Most good II is going to come from personal specializations** like this. What do you know of the world that most people do not?

&nbsp;

As important as II is, it's important to not *overemphasize* one singular company unless it makes sense to do so. If you're bullish on a company due to some II, it still needs to be the *cherry on top* of an otherwise already healthy company. 

**TL:DR** - Please include II (individual insight) as part of your DD. If you don't have any, it may be time to reconsider just how lucrative your DD post really is.
