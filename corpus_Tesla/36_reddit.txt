Alright well tesla is getting ready to break out and rally once again, now the question is when. It dropped from 900 to around 500 due to inflation fears as well as the market correcting itself . Now it has been range bound for the the last 3 months consolidating and creating strong levels of support .

[last 5 days](https://preview.redd.it/4shhy0b6ckj71.png?width=2028&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff63b9f6f68bf6f9dd6ec7f60f51705ed5f33a44)

Last week chip shortages caused a lot of stocks in the automotive industry to drop as the market priced it in , thus tesla dropped from the 700s to 640 before quickly rebounding back up to 700 . Furthermore tesla has been consolidating the past few days creating higher highs and higher lows .

the last  3 days

8/23- open 685.44 close 706.30

8/24- open 710.68 close 708.49

8/25- open 707.03 close 711.20

last 3 days tesla has been closing at higher levels each day. Furthermore Tesla held its support at 700, 705 and today created support at around 710. ( Its been consolidating and testing the 715 resistance ).

Its only a matter of time before tesla breaks out of this 3 month long channel and so far has created  strong levels of support at 550 , 620, 650 , 675-680 and as of now has turned the 700 level support into a support .

Ive been play calls this whole week as tesla tends to pump then drop and consolidate around vwap  these last few days . But i think it will soon break out either this week or next week.

This isnt financial advice and i am not a financial advisor 

This is just my view of the stock what do yall think of tesla and papa elon.
