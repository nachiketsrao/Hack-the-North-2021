Tesla is forming a bull pennant after its most recent run up last week. Could breakout soon as price moves further into the end of the pennant. Hard to tell if a breakout will follow considering the market has been so choppy recently. I have calls expiring friday which I bought eod today, good luck to all who decide to play this.
