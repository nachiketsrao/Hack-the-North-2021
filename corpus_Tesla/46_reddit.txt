Like a true fucking moron, I've yoloed student loan money since last October. Tesla calls made me rich, spac calls made me richer. Then February happened and spac calls made me considerably less rich. ðŸ¤¡ 

Anyhow, I'm too ugly to work behind the dumpster at Wendy's, so being fresh out of tendies, I embarked on an epic quest to search for work so I could still manage to pay my wife's boyfriend. And afford fresh cum socks.

I lied about everything on my resume, and somehow landed a job as a stock broker at a large financial institution. I you knew me, you would be absolutely dumb-founded that I pulled this off. I'm incredibly unqualified and retarded. My parents and brothers were absolutely mind-fucked that I'd managed to pull this off. My mom cried tears of joy at the news that her one retarded son was finally able to get a job. 

Which brings me to the main point of this post: **companies like Fidelity, Schwab, and Vanguard are desperate for employees. They're hiring anyone and everyone. Unlicensed on the phones is especially easy to get hired for, and they sponsor you for the series 7 exam to become a broker.** 

**I now get paid $22/hour working from home, jacking off and doing practically nothing.** The phone rings once every 15 or so minutes, and the rest of the time I'm on wallstreetbets, soaking in meme culture and trading on my own account, which is perfectly legal and allowed, as long as I don't front-run our clients. 

I love y'all, so wanted to pass on this beautiful brown nugget of wisdom: **apply at a financial institution like the ones mentioned above, get hired, work from home, and sit back trading the memestocks while getting paid hourly for it.** You also will become a licensed stock broker and learn a fuck-ton about the markets. There is so much to learn. If you're great at being retarded, why not get paid for it? Like the joker says, if you're good at something, never do it for free. 

I'm off to buy buttplugs now...
