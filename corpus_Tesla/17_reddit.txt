I am deeply attracted by the bold designs by Canoo at first sight even though most of those EVs are designed for business/workers instead of individual customers and really wish that I could own a truck or a van like that in the near future.  Yet shorts seem dominating the SP of the ticker and scare retailers away. There was a small short squeeze (up 30% without news) happened weeks ago but that's not the reason I create the post. I want to share all the knowledge I have about the company to discuss whether it is a good short term and long term investment. Potential short squeeze is of course a plus but that's not what I pursue here.

**Why shorts are hunting Canoo**

Canoo was founded in 2017 by executives from BMW, Tesla, Ford, etc and went public last year. The main reason shorts crowded in is the disastrous earning call in March, where the previous CEO Ulrich (along with chief lawyer Andrew) stepped away and the new CEO Tony took over the company.  The change of executives also triggered a SEC investigation on the company. Meanwhile, Canoo does not have cars in production yet and blew off the deals with Apple and Hyundai. Those negative news hence scared away retail investors and shorts come in and took over.

**Why I view the change of CEO positive**

Ulrich was later hired by Apple. (FYI, Apple reached Canoo in 2019 and 2020 for acquisition but Canoo turned it down. Canoo said that they don't want acquisition but investment.) Although many people view Ulrich's stepping down as a negative news, I view it differently.  The main disagreement between Ulrich and the board (including the new CEO Tony who invested $75million of his own money into the company), as I understand it,  is the business model and directions. Ulrich wants to create a subscription model for their vehicles (companies subscribe/lease vehicles) yet I don't think the Canoo board agreed. We have to admit that Ulrich contributed significantly to Canoo as Chief Technology Officer yet I don't think he can be a qualified CEO leading the company to right business model.  Tony, on the contrary, has abundant success business records.

**What has changed after March.**

Everyone seems keeping those bad memories of Canoo after the earning call and no one really cares about what is really going on under the new leadership.  Facts below:

&#x200B;

* Canoo received $300M incentives from the Oklahoma government to build their factory. FYI, Rivian (pre-IPO which is valued $80B) received $350M from the Texas government. I don't think those state governors are morons. The question is why Oklahoma governments picked Canoo instead of all other 'promising' EV companies out there.

* Canoo received 10,000 orders from FRONTdoor Collective executives (source: [https://www.freightwaves.com/news/qa-frontdoor-collective-executives-explain-importance-of-franchised-dsp-network](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/qa-frontdoor-collective-executives-explain-importance-of-franchised-dsp-network))
* Canoo has 9,500 non biding orders from individual customers.
* Canoo has signed contract with VDL Nedcar ( that produced BMW in Europe) source ([https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-names-vdl-nedcar-as-contract-manufacturing-partner](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-names-vdl-nedcar-as-contract-manufacturing-partner)) Their first batch of car will be on market in 2022q4.
* Canoo has been hunting for talents: the number of employees jumped from \~200 to \~700 and most of them are engineers. They have the ambassador Josette on board as the new president ( believe her connections can win Canoo government and international orders). (source: [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/canoo-names-ambassador-josette-sheeran-president-301340683.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/canoo-names-ambassador-josette-sheeran-president-301340683.html))
* Meanwhile, I think that Canoo has some news being held (The CEO mentioned in q2 earning call and there is either no news or big news), they have been actively expanding different markets (pest control, delivery. They attended different expos (ACT expo for example)  and received a lot of interests from companies like UPS for their MPDV type, they speak on Panel at World's Largest Mobility Event, etc.
* Rumors still stir around about the Apple and Canoo thing. I think as long as the price is seductive, there are always possibilities. I see a more possible situation as that Canoo focuses on hardware while Apple contributes the softwares (autonomous driving).

**What is the core technology behind Canoo**Skateboard technology + versatile/flexible modules. The skateboard technology they own saves a lot of space and create more rooms for passengers.  The modulization gives the advantage of customization and reduce the production cost as well.  Their MPDVs (MPDV I, II and III with different sizes) and Lifestyles Vans are to B while the pickup truck (expected to go to market in 2023) are to C. But I personally would like to customize a MPDV for traveling as well![https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-shows-off-performance-and-versatility-of-skateboard-platform-for-the-first-time-in-video](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-shows-off-performance-and-versatility-of-skateboard-platform-for-the-first-time-in-video)

**TL;DR**Canoo has $563.6 million in cash and $300million incentives received from the Oklahoma government. This combines into $863.6 million. The company currently valued at $1.65B (less than 2x of the cash equivalents the companies owned), which is far undervalued compared with its peers. It is like $NIO when it was at $3. Short float reported as 40% but it should be much higher than this.  This is the company that Apple reached for acquisition not a long time ago, and rumors and speculation still stirs around about the collaboration. Their design of vehicles always remind me of the feeling that I first time saw iphone 3gs.  And hopefully you guys can see me driving a Canoo Pickup or Van in the near future.Position: long term holder 2900 @$8.23 (still adding though). Do your own research and not a financial advice.
