Here's some perspective on the lopsided market that we are in. Traditional strategy is completely out the window. We no longer can analyze stocks based on fundamentals. This is absolutely insane but eventually we'll all pay the piper. Just look at the example of Tesla vs. BABA. I mean Tesla's revenue is a mere 11.96 Billion compared to Baba's massive 109 Billion. While Tesla's net profit margin is 9.55%, Baba's is at 21.91%. These market caps should be flipped. Tesla has a net income of 1.14 Billion and Baba has a net income of 21 Billion. These are the real numbers yet Tesla's market cap is almost a Trillion Dollars while BABA is barley above half that mark. Wild times.
