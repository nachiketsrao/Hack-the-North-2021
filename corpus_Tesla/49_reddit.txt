Not going to be able to live stream because my manager at Wendy's is an asshole ( blocked the wifi after he found us making trans cat girl porn on the back shift ğŸ˜» ) so does anyone know if it will be available on YouTube or something?? I would really like to watch at least some of it. 

Also has anyone talked to the guy who said tsla would be at $43,000 a share by the end of the decade??? 

Thanx ğŸ˜Š
