China is showing signs of an impending collapse. CCP crackdowns on tech, schooling, and the entertainment industries are desperate grasps for power as they see their inevitable downfall. 

China is in a housing bubble magnitudes larger than the 2008 US housing bubble. It is estimated the current Chinese housing bubble is over [$52 TRILLION](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-property-real-estate-boom-covid-pandemic-bubble-11594908517). Evergrande, Chinaâ€™s second largest developer, had a [bond trading halt](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-09-03/evergrande-s-local-bonds-faced-trading-halts-video). Across China, most 2023 maturity BONDS are down 40%+. Iâ€™m not talking about Stonks dropping in value, Iâ€™m talking about BOOMER BONDS. Evergrandeâ€™s stock is currently down over 80% this year. Evergrandeâ€™s debt profile is atrocious, [with over $360B of current debts](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/09/04/chinas-dodgy-debt-double-act). This data is from Chinaâ€˜s second best real estate developer. Imagine what the rest of Chinaâ€™s lower tier real estate developers financial pictures look like.   


Most Chinese people invest all their money into real estate. Stocks are not easily purchased by the average Chinese citizen. Real estate is a massive portion of their assets, so a collapse of the Chinese real estate market would be devastating to Chinaâ€˜s overall economy. Whinnie the Pooh knows this, which is why he is cracking down on virtually every sector of the Chinese economy. He is trying to take as much control as he can before the collapse happens.   


I plan to save the CUM Empire & the Europoors by loading up on YANG. YANG is a 3x inverse China  ETF. Monday is Labor Day, what better way to celebrate America ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ¦… than shorting China and betting on their imminent collapse? I will soon be swimming in money in my American Tesla, while poor Xi will be driving his Tesla copycat EV through Chinaâ€™s endless ghost cities. On Tuesday at open I will go ALL IN on YANG in my Roth IRA

\*\*The one thing to always remember about China is that no matter how bad something appears, it is likely multiple times worse than they present. China is following the path of the Soviet Union. Unfortunately this time the collapse will have an affect on the whole world, but I am going to make myself extremely rich in the process. You will soon see SirYoloGod on the Forbes list above Jack Ma and Whinnie the Pooh.\*\*

EDIT: There are so many salty BABA bagholders in here LOL
