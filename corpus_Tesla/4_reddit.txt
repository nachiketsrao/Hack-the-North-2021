My bull case for LCID: Just came out with great news that they have a longer range than Tesla, has now found support at the 200 day MA, with huge green volume and a clear change in momentum and the most bullish sign of all imo, the 14 period EMA on the daily just crossed above the 20 period MA. This thing has a short interest of 41% with the highest call written at 30. I don't normally post on here but this seems like a stock WSB would love, so here it is.
