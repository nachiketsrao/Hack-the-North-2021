The Q2 results blew expectations out of the water. Full self driving is coming this year. The market will wake up to the potential of robotaxis and go on a monster ralley just as big as 2020's, if not much much bigger. Oh have I mentioned the gigafactories? Giga Texas and Giga Berlin will be up and running, yep, this year. Tesla will be pumping vehicles like mad, and every vehicle is a robotaxi that will later be undercutting Uber and Lyft. 25 cents a mile, baby! Warren Redlich estimated a $3600 share price as early as 2022, using a measley p/e ratio of 30. It's absolutely going to be much higher than 30 p/e with the rate of growth.

Wage slaves will be freed and Teslanaires will be made. The shorts all still think Tesla's just a car company. Tesla's a car company as Amazon's a book store.
