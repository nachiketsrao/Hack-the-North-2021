Alright degens,

&#x200B;

We can all agree that if you post on WSB, you're not very smart. And the longer you're here, the more not smarter you get. Sometimes they don't think it be like it is, but it do.

&#x200B;

So with this understanding that your capacity to rub two neurons together is rapidly becoming a herculean task, you may as well keep a needle on what the smart people are doing in the market. With the advent of the Federal Reserve having decided that they will force inject money into the market, you need to figure out who is 'in the know' regarding near term federal policy.

&#x200B;

Enter Eric Rosengren and Robert Kaplan. Who are they? Well you sentient chair warmer, the former is the Boston Fed Chief and the latter is the Dallas Fed President. Both of these people have recently come under scrutiny for having the "appearance of conflicts of interest" in having sold millions of dollars worth of stocks amid the rapid growth after March of 2020. [Example.](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/fed-presidents-kaplan-rosengren-share-trades-conflicts-interest-apple-tesla-2021-09)

Now think about this appearance of impropriety. They have effectively been caught red handed doing what we all know and love, insider trading. So what should be the result? Divesting of profit, perhaps?

&#x200B;

Well think again, ya dingus. Apparently, all it takes to resolve this issue of impropriety is to finalize it by selling the stocks that have appreciated in value. In other words, *finish the job*. Come September 30, Kaplan and Rosengren will dutifully sell their positions on individual stocks, and hold this appreciated value in either broad index funds **or** cash equivalents.

In my suspicion, this provides two people that are ingrained in the Federal Reserve's strategy an out. They were able to hustle for over a year on several stocks that made rapid gains as a result of their policies, and now they are making the personal sacrifice to sell off their positions for profit in public view because "it's the right thing to do." In the event that we see a massive decline and point to Kaplan and Rosengren having sold right before Fed policy changes cause a massive drop, they can simply say "I just happened to get out due to ethical obligations." 

Neither of these two are obligated to hold positions tied to the market as they can hold these now secured gains in cash. Convenient, especially in light of the growing concern that the Fed's overarching recovery strategy [has not been working at intended.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/fed-economic-policy-powell-inflation-51631120497) In a nutshell:

1. The post-2010 recovery was the weakest since WWII
2. The Fed cannot get a handle on inflation rates
3. Economic inequality has become even more substantial

What do you even call the opposite of a hat trick? At the Fed, I would surmise that its called "radical change in what we do, and soon." Powell and the rest of the Fed understands that the issue with these policy disasters is not knowing that you need to get out--its knowing that every day that passes makes a resulting correction more substantial. And in this case, we're talking about ripping off a band-aid that is covering a gunshot wound to the saphenous vein so we can hopefully live long enough to suture it. 

**TL;DR**

Fed big bois selling their stocks at the high under the mask of being the right thing to do. Fed knows it botched the economic recovery and needs to shift gears now or cause even greater harm. Insiders at the Fed are getting out of their positions by the end of the month. Follow the people that have their fingers on the buttons.
