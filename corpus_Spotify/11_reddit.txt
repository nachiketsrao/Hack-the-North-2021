I feel like it's completely undervalued due to talks about stricter chinese regulations which have also hit other companies like BABA, etc....

As far as I know, they are a global company, not just chinese owned. And if my knowledge doesn't fail me, Spotify owns a large chunk of TME shares (46%?).


As for the 70k USD fine from the Chinese government, I think that's literally pocket change for them. So I don't see how that can deter growth.


Full disclosure: I already own some shares and I am thinking of buying more at the current low prices. Wondering what other retards might think.


Edit: All I see is the same bullshit reasoning: "china is bad so don't buy". No fundamentals, no factoring in the current discount, or the fact that the company actually makes money. 

From my experience lurking in this sub, it's better to do the opposite of what WSB says, to make money. Thanks for your responses, I'll buy more.
