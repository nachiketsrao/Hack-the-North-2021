I don't know how many of you are aware but for the last few months, Spotify have been successfully degrading the quality of their clients on all platforms massively.

I'm not even going to delve into all of this cause it's been heavily discussed with very sour and vocal posts on /r/spotify just sort by top 1 month/year or whatever. They've nuked the desktop client, made it look like it's designed for kids under 12 with asperger5, while giving you helpful "suggestions" on new albums they'd really like you to listen to, because their advertisers told them to. It's basically a complete shithow by now, I don't even think I have the choice to listen to what I want anymore, and they're already showing people forced ads.

The point I'm trying to make is, I realized today I'd rather give up my first born child than for them to take away the convenience of accessing my decade of emotionally expressive playlists. It's a no contest, have been subscribing for so long, I'm not gonna move to some plebian retard service like Apple Music, Google Play Music, Tidal, or whatever the fuck it's called. Spotify knows that I've been sneaking in Evanescense during my standups and they will just put more of that shit in my Discover Weekly.

Don't be retarded, buy uppies. At least a few months out.
