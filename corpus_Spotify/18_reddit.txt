We bought a company. That company is going to succeed AS LONG AS WE WANT IT TO.

Millions of people love what we did. Those millions of people will buy whatever GME produces because they are financially invested in its profit margin. Or maybe because they are emotionally sympathetic to it succeeding because their family members, friends, coworkers, or neighbors own a share.

If Gamestop wanted to introduce a movie streaming platform,  millions of people would subscribe to the GME movie app. We'd be as rich as Netflix. We are going to buy our products BECAUSE IT'S OUR COMPANY.

We wouldn't buy games from any other retailer, we would buy it from GME. 

If Gamestop started a music streaming platform, we'd download and subscribe to GME Music. We'd be as rich as Spotify and Apple Music.

We are the consumers. We have all the economic power in this situation.

I may be just another idiot WSB investor, but...

Prove me wrong.
