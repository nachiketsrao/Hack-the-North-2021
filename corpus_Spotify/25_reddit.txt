I've created 3 playlists for WSB based on user submissions. You guys know how to fucking JAM.

I'll get around to making some album covers for them, but if you guys want to take a crack at it, post them down below.

One for Austists, one for winners, and one for losers:

The loser's playlist is particularly empty.

Continue to submit songs.

EDIT: upvote the post for visibility you mongrels, we need more songs, and daddy needs more karma.
