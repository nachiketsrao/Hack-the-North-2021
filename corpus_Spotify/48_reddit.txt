* Sup nerds, back again with another idea that will probably blow up in my face, but whatever go big or go bust right? Im thinking a few November FD puts for some quick tendies as well as some deep OTM 2019 PUTs.
* Spotify earnings on Nov 1 PRE MARKET, so if your dumbass wants to follow $SPOT, buy your dumbass positions prior. 
* Spotify has no business sporting a $26 billion market cap with unoriginal IP. Google, Amazon, Apple and a slew of other tech companies have music streaming as more or less a "hobby" in their business model, but SPOT went balls deep and this is all they do. Their financials are fucked, profit line is about 1/10 their revenue. They have been falling steadily for weeks. I see a future penny stock. Could this be the next $SNAP?
*  The way this market is turning sour, shorting the lesser tech companies is the way to riches. PROVE ME WRONG.
