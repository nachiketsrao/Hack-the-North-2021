CFRA thinks ARKK (ARK Innovation ETF) has a high likelihood of outperforming its global equities ETF category in the next nine months based on our multi-faceted ratings approach,” they said, concluding, “stick with this top performing ARK ETF.”

Cathie Wood founded ARK in 2014 and has been in charge since then.

It’s also somewhat unusual for being an active, fully transparent manager of ETFs.

&#x200B;

Cathie Wood runs 7 different ETF's (of AT LEAST 1 year in existence) and they all have gone up from 177% to 391% in the last 16 months or from January 1,2020 to present.

Only included stocks (ETF's) with 1 or more years history. Did NOT include the ARKX fund or Ark Space Exploration & Innovation ETF since it is less than 1 month old, with a March 30,2021 inception date.

Hard to believe but the results AND charts speak for themselves .

&#x200B;

Even if you took out the March 2020 LOW prices and went with January 2020 or February 2020 highs (high share prices BEFORE the Covid19 or coronavirus stock market crash of March 2020),the results are nevertheless extremely impressive.

&#x200B;

High performance over one performance may be attributed to luck by SOME investors but when you consistently have greater than 20% yearly returns over 7 different stocks (or ETF's),then that is WORLD CLASS stock market skill. You are doing something RIGHT.

Cathie Wood is a genuinely extraordinary and extremely aggressive stock picker and analyst. No doubt about that. Her far above average results speak volumes about her skills and abilities.

&#x200B;

Extremely transparent stock picker who shockingly reports her various ETF's investments on a DAILY basis. Not monthly or weekly.

Love the transparency. Very, very unusual.

Let's look at her track record : Specializing in actively managed ETF's that focus on "INNOVATION" is obviously her success or stock market secret.

&#x200B;

All prices from March 2020 to February 2021.How the charts look like over the long-term for this extraordinary ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) or ARK Innovation ETF : 

Judge the ETF's on a minimum 9 to 12 months term basis, not over a 1 to 3 month or short-term basis.

April 1,2021 : If Your Mutual Fund Becomes an ETF, Here’s Why : Ark Investment Management’s Cathie Wood brought attention to the category with her slate of actively managed funds that were among the best performing U.S. ETFs in 2020.

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/if-your-mutual-fund-becomes-an-etf-heres-why/2021/04/01/937c43be-92af-11eb-aadc-af78701a30ca\_story.html](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/if-your-mutual-fund-becomes-an-etf-heres-why/2021/04/01/937c43be-92af-11eb-aadc-af78701a30ca_story.html)

&#x200B;

What’s the difference between a mutual fund and an ETF?

In both mutual funds and ETFs, investors are effectively pooling cash to buy assets by buying shares in the fund. However, mutual funds can only be purchased at the end of each trading day, while ETFs can be bought and sold INTRADAY.

Mutual funds tend to have higher minimum investment requirements and often charge higher fees.

"For most investors, ETFs are more tax efficient, as their structure allows them to minimize capital gains".

Although both come in actively-managed and passive forms, the majority of ETFs track indexes, while mutual funds are more commonly actively run by an investment manager.

&#x200B;

Cathie Wood : Worth $250 million as of October 13,2020 : Truly self-made and EXTREMELY successful.

&#x200B;

Cathie Wood certainly is a disruptor. Lots of gutsy and extremely unusual stock market moves . An early investor of Twilio Inc, Square Inc., Spotify Technology S.A. stock and Shopify Inc.

&#x200B;

Let's leave with the immortal words of John Templeton :

&#x200B;

“It is impossible to produce SUPERIOR performance unless you do SOMETHING DIFFERENT from the majority.”

Sir John Templeton : In 1954, he entered the mutual fund market and created the Templeton Growth Fund, which averaged growth over 15% per year for 38 years.
