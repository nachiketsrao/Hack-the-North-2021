Google Play Music is retiring and YouTube music is replacing it and it'll be removed from the app store in September. 

Here's all you need to know about the user experience : In order to get to my music, I need to navigate away from the main page, go to settings, then playlists and then find my old playlists. YouTube music is also using the same YouTube formula of recommending you bullshit and trying to make you listen to dog shit promoted content. 

ALSO, Google is so big brain they're moving podcasts to Google Podcasts only and music, just music, to YouTube music. Holy fucking shit. This cements in my mind that Google is a dog shit company and that if they didn't buy YT and have search they'd be in deep shit. 

I'm canceling YT premium, I'm buying Spotify, and I'm buying Spotify calls at an all time high because Google is that shit. Spotify any call Sept 25.
