In case anyone still needs to hear this, Roblox is a direct listing, not an IPO, and that matters.

Keeping this short and sweet because I’m high af but I keep seeing comments like “hOw mUCh cAn I eXPecT RoBlOx to go UP ToMmoRrow” in the daily discussion thread, so I figure this is necessary.

the reason IPOs go uppp on the first day trading is because the banks that carry the companies through the deal are incentivized to make the IPO price as low as possible so they get the most money from the process. 

For a direct listing that is not the case, since the company’s aim is to release the price as close to fair value as possible so they maximize their profits from the offering without too many shares being left unsold, which will lower the price and looks bad. 

Other companies that have Direct Listed:


PLTR: opened at $10 (my claim to fame is buying it at this price on opening), and closed at $9.50

Spotify: Opened at $165.90, closed at $149.01 

Asana: Opened at $27, closed at $28.80


There’s others, but as I said, it’s Tuesday which means I’m blazed so I’m too lazy to look them up.

Note: this is NOT a bear case for roblox! I’ve been too busy buying and selling DASH puts. It could go up or down, just be careful before making any  assumption that the price will pop hugely on day 1
