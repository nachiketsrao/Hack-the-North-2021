Wanted to post probably the best trade Iâ€™ve made. I started with ~12k last year and was able to get to >300k about a week and a half ago before nearly blowing up my account to 40k thanks to my greed and bad risk management. But thankfully I decided to go in on Spotify and save my account to hopefully be smarter about in the future.
