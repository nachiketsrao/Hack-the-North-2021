# BULLISH RUMORS OVER THE WEEKEND

* Big Twitch streamers like Ninja and Shroud possibly working with a new streaming service.
* A twitch streamer, Dr. Disrespect gets banned with no explanation
* 4Chan posts explains that Dr. Disrespect was working with the new Spotify streaming service so was banned from Twitch.  This post also stated Spotify was owned by Google so was questionable.
* Further amplified by Keemstar
* Further amplified by more $SPOT bulls on social media

# Ok?  So Spotify is now going to eat Twitch's lunch so buy calls?

* Yes, if the rumor is true, more bulls should be charging in
* $SPOT did rise on Monday, but lost it's steam.

# Some signs of a pump and dump attempt

* Someone registered a Twitter account called WatchBrime which is following famous Twitch streamers but none are following back.
* Someone registered a Twitter account called SpotifyGames (now banned)
* Even went as far as registering a domain name called [spotify-games.com](https://spotify-games.com) which gives a 401

# Is Spotify a good stock to buy?

Does anyone NOT use Spotify for music?  I don't listen to much music and I'm signed up for their premium service.

With the recent addition of Joe Rogan and Kim Kardashian, they are making exclusive content which further cements their position and shows that the company is on a path to become the next Netflix of audio (or maybe even video)

BUT, in the short run, it's run up too fast.

So short term bear, longer term bull.
