What do the WSB Autismos think of SPOT? I think it's undervalued as per my sophisticated stonk analysis below:
- main player in music streaming industry 
- adding podcasts and original content (juicier margins)
- competitors only offer music as secondary service 
- everyone has it and fookin loves it
- agnostic to Chinese cheers virus
