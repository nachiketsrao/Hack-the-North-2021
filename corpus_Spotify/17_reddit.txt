Joe Rogan is trending on Twitter, full of ppl digging up clips of him questioning Black Lives Matter https://twitter.com/itsavibe/status/1274061240139223040?s=19  wearing masks is for pvssies  https://twitter.com/RyanHoulihan/status/1273887080884682752?s=19 and making fun of his neighbor by calling them planet of the apes https://twitter.com/ChemicalMishap/status/1274102187371749385?s=19

I'm sure more old clips of him saying politically incorrect things will surface.
