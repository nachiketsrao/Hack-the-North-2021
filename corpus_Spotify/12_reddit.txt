Ok, no boring numbers or 10k reports to sift through on this one, just a very plausible theory. 

Obviously we all know (unless youâ€™re a boomer) Joe Rogan and Kim kardashian are going to podcast exclusively for Spotify. Links provided cos I know youâ€™re all to lazy to google.

Well hereâ€™s why that really matters. A lot of people like me, like to watch the rogan podcast, not listen to it, so spotify clearly wants to directly challenge YT, twitch and FB as a video streaming service. 

So hereâ€™s the juicy part, Probably the biggest streamer on twitch has just been banned Dr disrespect after mentioning David Icke on stream. Except the whole thing kind of looks like a pr setup...

Rogan also said one of the main reasons he left was because of YouTube censorship of particular topics, ie mentioning Icke gets you banned. so is Dr disrespect leaving twitch to go somewhere else? ðŸ‘€ is this him hinting that? 

Well hereâ€™s the realllll cookie, are ninja, shroud and DR D all going to announce Spotify partnerships soon? Theyâ€™ve all just turned down a multi-million offer to go to Facebook and there arenâ€™t any other big platforms so whereeeeeee are they going? ðŸ˜‰

Position?  Iâ€™m not you financial advisor you figure it out but long spot.
