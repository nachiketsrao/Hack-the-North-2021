Spotify/ google home mini

If you have Spotify premium you get a free google home mini when you check out. Student accounts donâ€™t apply for this.

Idk if this will help out google or Spotify stocks but I know damn well that a free google home will help me listen to music while I cry seeing my accounts tank.
