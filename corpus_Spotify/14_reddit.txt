Kim Kardashian will start a new podcast exclusively with Spotify mostly talking about her work with The Innocence Project, a project that focuses on exonerating wrongfully convicted individuals. This couldn’t come at a better time with the racial injustice protests happening in the US. 

The last time Spotify did a podcast deal was with Joe Rogan just last month on May 19. The stock price skyrocketed! This is free money that can’t go tits up. Calls on Spotify. You’re welcome. 

Spot $210c 06/19

Edit: Up 850% for the day. And 99% of this post disagreed with me. I literally said it can’t go tits up but half of you are retarded anyway so what does it matter. Big fuck you to all who doubted this post.
