Some thoughts on API. No position yet. Want to see what you guys think. 

>*API*

**Industry attractiveness**

\- RTE adoptions among Twitter, Spotify, Facebook

\- Unverified rumors - Greenroom (Spotify) is built using API

**Market bears misconceptions** 

\- tying API to Clubhouse (Clubhouse sign up has slowed down drastically)

\- tying API to the Chinese Education sector (going through regulation reform, 35% revenue in danger)

**Competitive Dynamics**

\- RTE (Agora business) doesn't use CDN which could provide better communication when networks/sites are down. The problem surfaced during recent Airline & bank websites went down due to major internet failure. Brad Altfest (Agora Director of BD posted a message around how Agora can help bank and airline prevent such risks in the future)

\- Agora's new App Builder - zero coding and suitable for firms looking to have their own branded Zoom Calls.

**Key developments**

\- New partnership with HP. Felt like an early version of ROKU when it first partnered with TV manufactures

\- [Symbl.ai](https://Symbl.ai) can transcript [Agora.io](https://Agora.io) stream into transcripts. A live demo code can be found here

\- Acquisition of Netless - The White-SDK from Netless is a cross-platform, real-time, interactive whiteboard solution. 

\- partnership with HTC for VIVE to accelerate the adoption of VR innovation in real-time engagement

The market is focusing on what Agora is doing now (Education, clubhouse), I felt maybe it's time to move in and focus on the next round - ROKU-like strategy and invading the mission-critical operations now relying on the internets.
