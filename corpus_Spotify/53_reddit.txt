What I mean by $KYLE is a portfolio based on all the stereotypes based around gamers and suburban youths.

Console/PC hardware: SNE(Sony), MSFT, CRSR, NVDA, AMD, NTDOY

Energy drinks: KO & PEP

Marijuana: Not gonna risk a ban by listing some of the tickers recently posted here, but I'm sure you all have a few you've been following.

Dev studios for games and entertainment: EA, TTWO(Take two), CCOEY (capcom) NFLX, GOOGL

Home security: RING, RGR (Ruger), SWBI (Smith and Wesson)

Fast food: MCD (mcdonalds), YUM (kfc, pizza hut, a few others), QSR (tim hortons, burger king)

Rap: SPOT (spotify)

Has anyone done this? Is there a different name for it? google doesn't bring anything up but maybe I'm not using the right search parameters?

Should I add any other stocks?

I'm thinking I'm gonna build this portfolio on ToS with papermoney and track it but just wanted to see first if I'm wasting my time.

Thanks fucktards, hope you have a great weekend mowing the lawn and washing your wife's boyfriends car.
