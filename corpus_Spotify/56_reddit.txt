I'm going to keep this short and sweet for you guys. 

BFT is merging with the company PaySafe. This a legitimate company.

Highlights for PaySafe- 

In business for over twenty years. This is a processing payment company that focuses on creating a niche in the gambling and iGaming industry. Notable customers include Twitch, Fortnite, Roblox,Stadia, Spotify, Draftkings, and various other lotteries. They also acquired Skrill which allows payment processing using currencies that cannot be named here.

If you want to read more about BFT here's a post from u/dhsmatt2 [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kaabxa/700000\_bet\_on\_fintech\_bft/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kaabxa/700000_bet_on_fintech_bft/)

The bottom line is this company is sound, it is not a pump and dump.

Enough of the fundamental stuff, because let's be honest - none of that matters anymore. Here are the most recent developments which are going to cause this stock moon:

This stock is part of the Fintech sector. The three big sectors that see the greatest rise in price movement are EV, Fintech, and Tech stocks.

This stock has had the HIGHEST VOLUME FOR 5 DAYS of any SPAC. How do I know? Because I track it and post it everyday, check my profile. This is likely because large institutions are accumulating shares and this will be reported/leaked in coming weeks which will further drive up the price. This SPAC has a floor of around 10, but given the significant accumulation around 12-13 there is significant support at this area.

This stock is already being mentioned on CNBC (twice last week). When the boomers and WSB both agree that a stock is a solid investment, there's likely to be a large increase in price.

Other notable mentions include a significant increase of Stocktwits followers - increased by 30% this weekend but still under 15k. There have also been 5 YouTube videos just today.

Lastly here's my position - Original 200k bet - now worth 230k.

TLDR: This SPAC's acquisition is the right sector, the right time, with a traditional and social media following to make this potentially the next mega stock. NAV is 10, likely large institutional buying creating significant support around 13.  You don't want to miss out as Monday morning might be the last chance.
