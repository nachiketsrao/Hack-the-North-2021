Since apparently you all consider each other financial advisors, I guess I need to tell you, I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice.

Hello and welcome to my DD for Sirius XM **($SIRI**), not to be confused with Apple's benevolent AI assistant. This is actually my first DD for you all, I hope you enjoy it. Sirius XM owns their satellite radio company and network, which is **factory installed in about 75% of new American cars**, and they **purchased Pandora in December 2019**, which was the largest internet radio company, whose only real competition is Spotify. I believe the company hasn't fully captured the gains from Pandora's acquisition, and it's in a perfect position to explode with smarter, connected vehicles becoming the norm. Pandora has by far the best learning algorithm to customize stations, and it's primed for some big deals, like the one it just signed with T-Mobile. This stock looks to me to be a fantastic pick, and here's some facts for you all:

1. The **float is 930M-960M shares**, and the short interest has hovered around 160M-200M shares for the past few years (20% of the float). **I know WSB loves to know about short interest, and that's damn high.**
2. Fundamentals are a dirty word here too, but this stock has pretty great fundamentals. **It's got a 25-35 P/E**, which is both low for a value stock, and low for a growth stock. 45 would be a conservative P/E for a company of this type, while a growth-focused company like Spotify has a -77 P/E ratio and **TSLA has a 1300+ P/E ratio**. Price tripling or quadrupling wouldn't be too difficult to stomach for the market, and that's not even what will happen if this goes to its rightful place in the **stars**.

2a. Still fundamental, **SIRI is actually profitable**, and managed to turn a profit even in the driving hell year of 2020. Almost every market caller has this ranked as being at least a $7-$8 stock, and they don't believe in the squeeze. **If this hits $10, that basically breaks open the option chain, and the market makers and hedges will have to scramble to hedge the stock properly.**

3. The stock is consistently trading in medium-high volumes (though nowhere near the short interest volume), meaning it's ready to move. For a stock with such high volume, **it's clearly only short interest holding the price down**. If market sentiment turns from neutral to bullish, this thing is going to take off.

4. **With low IV in the current option chain, nobody sees this coming. The buy-in on LEAPS is still cheap, and the upside is huge.** This stock looks like a no brainer, easily gonna go up in both the short term and long term, and potential to go way, way over the moon.

If you need positions, I own 500 shares and 50 LEAPS on this stock. **My short term price target is $9 by summer 2021, and $19 by summer 2022. Buy LEAPS on this, buy some shares, and print your own tickets.**

edit: The catalyst, since it's been asked, is that they merged with Pandora just before the pandemic hit and destroyed the economy. The purchase of another major company never even moved the needle, and there's pent up growth to realize as soon as things reopen, advertising starts to pick up again, and people start buying things. Spotify is their big competition right now, and Spotify is hemorrhaging money, that means there's gonna be a reckoning.
