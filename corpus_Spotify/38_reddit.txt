SiriusXm is now standard on Jaguar/Land Rover, BMW, Toyota, GM, Kia/Hyundai.   In a couple years most of the OEMs will be featuring siriusxm similar to terrestrial radio.  I will not be surprised if the dealers will be offering siriusxm radio for 3 to 5 years as a standard part of the transaction.  

Let it make it clear.  I am not advocating sirius xm as a service but rather as a Business whose $1.668 B fcf in 2020 is 8 more than spotify's and probably more than all streamers combined.  For some reason, most folks associate the company with siriusxm radio only.  This was the case five years ago, and a huge mistake to think now.  Today, siriusxm owns Pandora, is the leading digital ads technology  thanks to AdsWizz and Simplecast, that just surpassed 1 B monthly downloads, owns about 15% of SoundCloud, and 100% of Stitcher, on of the top 4 podcasts in the country.  I expect the share price to double already this year with Q1 to be a blowout quarter.
