In the Middle East and surrounding MENA region, similarly to the rest of the world, there is a huge rising popularity in Music Streaming. While Spotify is slowly becoming the monopoly in this sector in the Western world, this app has its own little field, in that it tailors specifically to Middle Eastern/Arabic listeners and artists.

Anghami has been recently acquired and is planned to IPO on the NASDAQ in 2021, making it the first Arab Tech Company to be traded on the NASDAQ.

**\*User Breakdown\***

Anghami Currently has 70 million active users. Compared to their 2019 Q1 user base, which was 21 million at the time, that is a **233%** increase.

For contrast, in this same time frame Spotify went from 160 Million active users to 286 active users, a 78% increase. ( [Spotify](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/spotify-statistics/#:~:text=during%20Q3%202018-,Spotify%20User%20Statistics,Premium%20subscribers%20in%20Q4%202019) )

**\*Recent acquisition\***

Just very recently, it was announced that acquisition company 'Vistas Media Capital', alongside SHUAAInvestment Banking (a UAE based asset management and investment firm), have both committed $40 Million ($30 Million = Vistas, $20Million = SHUAAInvestment ) to effectively merge Anghami with Vistas Media Capital.

**\*Vistas Media Capital \***

The blank check company IPO'd last August, with an initial pricing of $10 and a volume of 10M. I can't find much on previous activities of this company prior to, or even after the IPO, beyond this merger it does not seem like they have done much.

Here's the company mission statement

'**Vistas Media Acquisition Company Inc. (NASDAQ:VMACU) (‚ÄúVMAC‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) is a blank check company, also commonly referred to as a Special Purpose Acquisition Company, or SPAC, formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities in the Global Media and Entertainment sector. The Company intends to identify a target business in the Global Media & Entertainment sector. '**

Past their IPO, they kept trading sideways at around $10 with occasional dips and peaks, hitting a 52W low at 9.91 and a high of 12.55. ( [VMACU](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/vmacu?mod=mw_quote_tab) , [Vistas Media Acquisition](https://vmac.media/) )

**\*SHUAACapital\***

This is where things get a bit fucky from my end due to this being the UAE market and in Dirham, the local currency there. I tried my best to synthesize what little information I could find and come to some sort of conclusion on them.

First off, SHUAA:

**'is a United Arab Emirates-based company engaged in the provision of financial and investment services. The Company is organized into five segments: the Asset Management segment manages conventional equity, debt and money market, as well as Shariah compliant portfolios and investment funds using both active and passive management styles; the Investment banking segment provides corporate finance advisory, private placements, public offerings of equity and debt securities, among others; the Brokerage segment operates under the brand of SHUAA Securities and acts as principal and agent, providing custody and clearing services to clients, providing access to regional exchanges'**

Some interesting figures and news pertaining to SHUAACapital, [they were up 200% in profits in 2019-2020 ](https://www.khaleejtimes.com/business/corporate/shuaas-2020-net-profit-surges-166-to-dh125m), and they [Won two awards 'Asset Management Company of The Year' and 'Best Investment Bank in MENA'](https://www.albawaba.com/business/pr/shuaa-capital-secures-two-awards-back-strong-2020-1412362) . Not sure who's giving out these awards but, hey! Good for SHUAA! Publicity is publicity.

As I mentioned, they are far better established than VMACU, already trading on the Dubai Financial Market for the past 21 years. It's essentially a penny stock, with a high of 1.8 AED (0.51 USD) and currently trading sideways at around 0.6 AED (0.17 USD) . ( [SHUAA Capital Investor Relations](https://www.shuaa.com/investor-relations/) , [$SHUAA](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SHUAA:UH) )

(btw: I joined SHUAACapital even though they are two seperate words, just so the automod doesn't freak over the penny stock mention)

**\*My Moves\***

So, even though the acquisition isn't by catalysts big enough to singlehandedly cause a stir, I am still very bullish simply due to the hold Anghami has in that sector.

Some 'westernized' middle easterners may use Spotify or other similar services, but what you need to know is the biggest market to hit on is not the same demographic as a Middle Eastern reddit user. To expand on this: Across Various 'social circles' in the Middle East and surrounding countries the technology and platforms used also vary significantly.

More specifically, for example, a kid from Egypt that went to a private school and talks English with his friends and mainly listens to rap and not Egyptian music is not the demographic, but he is also not the majority in these locales. 

The majority is public schooled people, who are not as westernized and mainly listen to Egyptian for the sake of our example, and similar music from the surrounding culture. This exact market is what Anghami has completely nailed. None of the people who purely want to listen to their regional artists and music will go to any other platform than Anghami. As a person with a Middle Eastern Background, trust me this app is the one taking over in this field. Kind of similar to how Jumia is also taking over the online ordering market by sculpting their services for the areas in which they are offered. 

I would not be surprised if some low-grade mobile companies team up and have it as a default app for phones sold in this region. Generally just lots of potential and the team behind the main app has been very good in stimulating growth.

They are looking to IPO in late Q2 of 2021, and in my opinion they can only really go up from there. Interested to hear everyone else's thoughts.
