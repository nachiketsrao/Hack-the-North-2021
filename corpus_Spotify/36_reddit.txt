SiriusXM radios will be installed this year on about 80% of all manufactured autos in this country.  This means that about 13 M vehicles are going to have siriusxm radio with production at 16 M in 2021. 

What is even more exciting that siriusxm is now standard in a number of manufacturers.  The most recent is Jaguar/Land Rover.

Moreover, about 4.5 M autos of the estimated 16 M produced this year will feature 360L, an interactive wi-fi radio that will enable the company to increase retention and introduce targeted ads.

Today is siriusxm is standard or quasi standard on major auto manufacturers like Toyota, GM, BMW Hyundai, Kia, Fiat Chrysler.  It is reasonable to expect that it will become standard on most auto and large trucks in the next five years.
