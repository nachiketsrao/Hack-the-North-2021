**UPDATE: 3/4**

EPD I like the stock. 

Don‚Äôt like much else. 

üö® **9:25 AM: JEROME ON SOME BULLSHIT TAKE PROFITS** üö® 

**3/4 ANOTHER UPDATE 7:15 AM: OIL CALL FLOW WAS CORRECT OPEC+ MEGA BOOOLISH RHETORIC LEAKING BUY BUY BUY**

**3/4 update:** Most profits taken on EPD when it went above 23. All those calls went ITM this week. Chillin now while awaiting Powell

**Another 3/3 update**

Taking oil profits and sitting the rest of the day out, going to read up a bit on current index price action and see whatsup tomorrow.  I‚Äôll post anything interesting I find. 

**Clarification**: not selling EPD

**3/3 mid day update:**

Looks like the EPD call and 3/2 oil Update were on the right track. Holding off on buying any of the tech for Rambo rn while letting those run. Closed out any ded tech. 

**Night shift RAMBO update 3/2**

All the news coming out about OPEC+ is bearish, but I keep on seeing repeat OTM 3/19 call buying on all oil tickers.  *My spidey sense tingles*. 

**The State of our DD: Update 3/2**

Shitty market movement but nothing unexpected on our underlyings. Tech zoomed Monday‚Äî DOCU was a one day hold, but **remember to check the events scheduled on ones like CRM and NVDA for when you want to enter**. These are volatile times for tech and we‚Äôre playing pops. 

**We got concerning news on Energy with Saudi‚Äôs saying they‚Äôll loosen oil supply**. Tomorrow is the ESG portion of EPD and XOM is having an investor day‚Äî I‚Äôm going to let XOM movement determine if I am scared or not since it will be a litmus for Thursday EPD event. 

BIDU doing its thing let‚Äôs hope it keeps up. CRM sucks ass as always but it‚Äôs the schedule I‚Äôm gonna play, not the stonk. 

So far I am okay with things have played out after a big Monday, and luckily we have far dates on deez bitches

**Last week‚Äôs 1x-to-multi-baggers:** SPOT SNAP BA

*I use Barchart and TOS for general flow, but use Unusual Whales scanner for most of my UOA picks. Shoutout to them for giving permission to use screenshots and such that I‚Äôm playing.* 

**UPDATE: DOCU CEO** speaking at Morgan Stanly TMT conference Monday AM. [This 300c 3/5 came through last week](https://i.imgur.com/dD2cqVp.jpg). Suicidal strike, but I like the sentiment. 

****

When the shit hits the fan and the indexes are falling, I'm in the lab trying to spot the bullish diamonds in the rough.  **Why?  Because the moment I buy a put, we are going to new all-time highs**.  I just know it.  So, I've had to work a little harder to pull out the calls, and I'm happy for those of you that got the SPOT, SNAP, and BA tendies from last week's DD.  XPEV was kind of weird too--I guess I need to take buy American.  Honestly, I'll take 3.5/5 for picks on a bloody week any day, though.

**Please remember**: When things are this volatile, **choose your entries after market action seems to pick a direction AFTER the first hour of the day**, minimum, unless we're playing a specific event.  The difference between a failing play and a 30% intraday play can literally be the difference between buying at open, or buying two hours later. And don't get greedy--this is guerilla warfare right now.  Take your pop profits, unless you have PDT restriction in which case go tighter to the strike, and much longer than the whale.  **If you can‚Äôt afford it, don‚Äôt play it.** There are opportunities every day. 

Anyway, I want to go in a little different direction this week, as something interesting stood out to me.  Ready? Let's roll.

****

**1.	The SPOT Whale: Anatomy of a carcass**

On Monday, as I dined on SPOT tendies while the world burned around me, I was struck with a sense of unease amidst the clinking of champagne glasses.  On Sunday afternoon after the DD was written, some further research revealed that, at **8 AM on Monday 2/22, SPOT was hosting an ‚Äúinvestor day‚Äù**.  Investor day was indeed the whale's bet, and boy did it pay off with that 8% intraday pop.

I hadn't heard the term investor day or analyst day thrown around in tech for a bit, so my spidey sense was tingling.

Then, the next interesting hits came.  Last week's Whales to Watch had SNAP picked as another play to follow based on OTM call activity and repeat betting.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, amidst the storm, SNAP indeed went nuts with intraday pops.  TWTR, which I'd made a note of the week prior, had the same activity.  **What was the seemingly invisible string tying these three tech plays together?  Investor/analyst days.**

It was time to get to work.

****

**2.	The investigation**

I wanted to see if these investor and analyst days were a recycled and growing phenonemon or something we just haven't paid much attention to.  The results were interesting in two ways.

1) [SNAP](https://investor.snap.com/overview/default.aspx) [SPOT](https://investors.spotify.com/home/default.aspx) and [TWTR](https://investor.twitterinc.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx) **investor relations pages show these events in 2021, but not in 2020 or 2019**.  Earnings? Sure.  Annual meetings? Indubitably.  Conferences? Yes.  Investor/analyst days?  Nay.  Small sample size obviously, but coming from these three within the same quarter after not having hosted any of these events over the past two years--I'd call it significant.

2) **SNAP SPOT and TWTR investor/analyst days all came shortly after their Earnings Reports** (this is important later).  SNAP ER was 2/4, Investor Day was 2/23.  SPOT ER was 2/5, Investor Day was 2/22.  TWTR ER 2/9, Analyst Day was 2/25.

*All three* of these tickers had OTM Whale bets with expirations the week of the investor/analyst events.  *All three* of these came within a month of their ER.  *All three* of these pumped due to events specifically designed to do just that--pump. 

*NOTE: I did some quick searching of recent pumped tech, and PYPL employed the same strategy.  No "investor day" in 2020, yet after their ER on 2/3/21 they hosted an investor day on 2/11*

These companies may as well have held up neon fucking signs that said "WE ARE HAVING A VIRTUAL EVENT WHERE WE ARE GOING TO PAUMP OUR BRAINS OUT".

****

**3.	Defining RAMBO**

As I continued to poke around I saw more and more similar examples.  **Simple searches of OTM whale activity for specific dates on the tickers, which is then checked against the upcoming investor relations, conferences, and meetings on their corporate sites, gives valuable input for what may be brewing.**

I also saw that [Morgan Stanley is hosting its annual Technology, Media, and Telecom conference](https://esn.net/morgan-stanley-technology-media-and-telecom-conference-march-1-2021/). Among others, our favorite FSLY is set to present üò¨ üòâ.

**Given that these plays coincide with investor relations, meetings/conferences, and are blatant pumps, I‚Äôll refer to it as RAMBO: Relations and Meeting Buy Opportunities.**

****

**4. Theorizing recent increases of RAMBO** 

**What stuck out to me was that these recent tech RAMBOs were scheduled to come shortly after their earnings reports**.  SPOT, if you're going to change the world with podcasts in Sierra Leone or whatever, *why not* announce it during the ER you had a couple weeks priorbefore?  **The same can be asked of others like PYPL, SNAP, TWTR, etc.**

**My theory is that the current ER environment‚Äîwhere your stock plummets unless your forward guidance calls for a 10,000% estimate beat, means that companies are working around these unrealistic expectations by saving their best news for afterwards**.  In a way, they are hedging against their own reporting with news coming out during a less volatile time.  After seeing the success of this manuever this past week, I wouldn't be surprised if we witnessed a new normal where earnings reports are almost always scheduled with a traling investor day, analyst day, or key meeting/conference. 

**5. So what am I saying?**

I'm saying that, given the volatile environment around earnings reports and troubling market conditions, **we are likely to see an uptrend in OTM whale calls coinciding with RAMBO, separate from earnings reports**.  One of the first things I will be doing when I see a call flow or whale activity that I like is check it against the companies' investor relations page and seeing what events they may be taking advantage of.

**Hunting for RAMBO: Picks I‚Äôll test this on (in light of JNJ vaccine this weekend, wait on price action to settle for Tech calls)**

[EPD](https://i.imgur.com/U18rGpb.jpg) üöÄ üöÄ 

Dipping a toe in with this nice, boring, boomer midstream oil giant.  They pay a fat ass dividend yield of 8.3% but let's be real--I couldn't care less about that because this DD is about the hunt for glory, not my retirement income.

The real opportunity is in the fact that, on Friday, two separate bets were placed for EPD in the near future, including a 23c for 3/26.  [They coincided with upcoming RAMBO, as EPD is holding an investor day on March 4th, with an ESG discussion preceding it on March 3rd](https://www.enterpriseproducts.com/investors/presentations).  They are also holding a Q and A session to field questions from both events.

You know who else scheduled a Q and A to discuss their investor day?  SPOT did last week.  I see this as a confidence move, and I see the whale probably thinking their little investor daycould, potentially, be newsworthy.  I'll roll the dice here but keep it safe, and drop if the news is a dud.  As a side note, though, oil is just a good long term play for 2021.  My XOM and RDS leaps have been puh-rinting.

As always pick a good entry point.

[BIDU](https://i.imgur.com/G5XaBOD.jpg) üöÄ üöÄ 

**EDIT**: the BIDU stock split isn‚Äôt the traditional one folks go crazy for but is instead a pre-HK listing split with a neutral effect (affect? Whatever. ) on NASDAQ share prices . Whales and call flow likely related to the HK listing more so than split benefits outright 

Yeah yeah I know, I will be shilling BIDU to the grave.  But, I saw some more interesting call activity on them (it never stops), and a nice little 420 3/26c that piqued my interest.  **I hopped over to the investor relations page looking for summadat RAMBO and found this**:

>BEIJING, Jan. 22, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Baidu, Inc. (Nasdaq: BIDU) ("Baidu" or the "Company"), a leading Internet platform and AI company, today announced that it will hold an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the "EGM") at 11:00 a.m. on March 1, 2021 (Beijing time) at the address of No. 10 Shangdi 10th Street, Haidian District, Beijing, the People's Republic of China.
A proposal of changing the Company's authorized share capital by one-to-eighty subdivision of shares ("Share Subdivision") will be submitted to Baidu's shareholders to be considered and voted upon at the EGM.

Yes, that's right. BIDU is voting on a stock split Monday.  This is also coming ahead of their HK listing to happen soon.  Do I need to remind you what happens in the lead up to a company's split date?  Remember TSLA?  Remember AAPL?  Well, this ain't ether of those lol, but I like the news and dammit, I like the stock!  Can I tell you exactly what they do?  NO.  Can I tell you how much of my life savings is going in?  ALOT.

[CRM](https://i.imgur.com/25AMtPg.jpg) üöÄ üò¨ 

CRM has been beaten to within an inch of its life recently, and you know I love a good falling knife.  Outside of that nearing bottom, though, they've got an interesting slate of speaking arrangements lined up with this 4/9 275c.  [They're trotting out every executive they have for shilling this coming week, alone](https://investor.salesforce.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx).  I'll play it a little safer, a little longer, but I'm in for fishing the bottom here.

[ZNGA](https://i.imgur.com/cTLGZLk.jpg) üöÄ üò¨ 

Whale came through with a conservative bet, but I'll be curious to see what they have to say at upcoming conferences after their CEO essentially begged for somebody to buy them out after ER lol (not really, but yeah kinda).  [They're speaking at the Morgan Stanley Tech Conference on March 5th, 8:25 AM PST](https://investor.zynga.com/news-releases/news-release-details/zynga-present-morgan-stanley-technology-media-telecom-conference)

[NVDA](https://i.imgur.com/TFrRmTn.jpg) üöÄ üöÄ 

I'm as sick of hearing about the damn chip shortage as you are, but NVDA has their annual investor day coming up on 4/12 and calls are starting to trickle in.  Going to feel out this tech dip then probably go with some call spreads near the 600 range for May--outright call premiums are just insane for this ticker, I don't care how rich you are.

**Ticker I just like this week**: **JNJ** because I‚Äôm a bandwagon hopper ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  and **PDD** ER lotto gamble

****

**TLDR**:
Check the investor relations page if you use call flow or Unusual Options Activity scanners, as a lot of newsworthy positive developments seem to be shared via satellite events recently, not during ER.  Investor day is the new earnings report.

I like tickers: **EPD BIDU CRM ZNGA JNJ NVDA**. All long, on dips, and buying in tandem with the above mentioned special datesj
