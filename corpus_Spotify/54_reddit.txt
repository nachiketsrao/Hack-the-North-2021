I bought one SPY call at the peak during 2/20 and the market crashed. I bought SPY call at the peak of 6/8 again and market pulled back hard. I bought a SPY at the peak of 7/23 and SPY pulled back $8 in less than 5 minutes. I bought one Spotify call at the 299 peak on 7/22 and SPOT crashed the next day. I bought one PURPLE NURPLE call at the price you already knew it. Total [loss](http://imgur.com/gallery/EQD6mT9) of june and july.

I bought an Apple call last week when it was 514 and it dropped to 499. I bought another apple call this morning at 128 and it couldnt erect past 130

Tomorrow I will test my ability by buying one tesla call.
