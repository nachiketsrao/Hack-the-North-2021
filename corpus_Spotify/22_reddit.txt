Hello fellow retards

I know these are difficult times for this sub and it‚Äôs almost impossible to post something solid which is not about the current meme stocks.

Instead of jerking to some porn i did some research on PLTR and want to share my DD with you. This might be a longer text for your love dopamine level so maybe you should grab some your Adderall before.

The following text might you give your eyes aids since English isn‚Äôt my native language. I will try my best.

**Palantir as a Company ‚Äì the beginnings**

PLTR was founded by some people and one of them is Peter Thiel who worked alongside with our holy papa Elon at PayPal. As a payment-service they had concerns about money laundering and founded PLTR to tackle this issue early. The CIA also funded PLTR (they are always funding stuff like this ‚Äì Siri as example). This actually might be the reason why people think that PLTR is a company which aggregates data and do data analysis for the government‚Ä¶.but this is not accurate and not correct at all if you see the big picture. I will explain this point later.

You retard still reading? Nice here some rocket emoji‚Äôs to pump your dopamine and keep you happy. üöÄüöÄüöÄ

Let‚Äôs start with the DD

First of all my POV is looking for a midterm to long term investment in PLTR. My valuation considers PLTRs current state and predicting from now on for the next few years.

&#x200B;

* **1. The Management**

Before I start with the product I rather start with the management. You can sell the nicest thing in the world. I can guarantee you that the product definitely won‚Äôt be considered as the nicest thing after a while if you have a shitty management (Intel). With Peter Thiel on the leaderboard we got a competent asshole and CEO is Alex carp (co-founder) Peter Thiel is well known and Alex Karp is one of us. He yolod his heritage into some business and become a chad. Seriously tho, I trust Peter and if Peter holds on Alex since Decades so do I. Peter proved so many times how cunning he is and showed how to pick adapt problems early and create solutions.

&#x200B;

* **2. PLTR Business model/ products**

Before we understand how important PLTRs products are we have to understand that we are simpeltons who don‚Äôt have any business with PLTRs. We create data. We don‚Äôt fuck with it. We creating with using our phones or working in the office. Only a few of us may working with accumulated big data. PLTRs customers‚Äô base isn‚Äôt neighbor Joe or Aunt Nancy. The products they offer are not even for midcap companies they are more designed for whole industries and governments. That‚Äôs the reason why their products aren‚Äôt so tangible for many people.

PLTR basically offers systems to big companies/governments which import their data into these systems. PLTR doesn‚Äôt sends workers to the client to collect data and analyse it. They sell platforms. They got 2 Products called ‚ÄúGotham‚Äù and ‚ÄúFoundry‚Äù You may think wtf is this guy talking about? Let me explain it in 2 examples:

First example is Syria with Gotham. It was impossible in the country to know who the good guys are and who the bad ones are. I know u muricans only know yourself and the rest of the world is the ‚Äúrest of the world‚Äù for you. But this wasn‚Äôt so simple in Syria you had many factions with different intentions and some of them were allies and some of them were enemies. The lack of information or the ability of recognizing and sorting these information‚Äôs are crucial in a war. PLTR solved the struggle with creating a map which provided resilient information for the marines so they can operate safely. Civil problems over there could also be fixed.

[https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/10/04/palantir-using-big-data-to-solve-big-humanitarian-crises/](https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/10/04/palantir-using-big-data-to-solve-big-humanitarian-crises/)

Actually what the John Hopkins University does with the covid numbers and the map, is some sort of what PLTR offering with their solutions. There are rumors that the tracking of Covid and the vaccination will be done by PLTR.

In their S1 Form PLTR describes it this way

‚ÄúGotham, our first software platform, was constructed for analysts at defense and intelligence agencies. They were hunting for needles not in one, but in thousands of haystacks. And they did not have the software they needed to do their jobs. In Afghanistan and Iraq, soldiers were mapping networks of insurgents and makers of roadside bombs by hand. Gotham enables users to identify patterns hidden deep within datasets, ranging from signals intelligence sources to reports from confidential informants, and helps U.S. and allied military personnel find what they are looking for.‚Äù

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm#rom904406\_11](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm#rom904406_11)

The second example is about ‚ÄúFoundry‚Äù and it‚Äôs directly from the S1 File of PLTR (page 121)

‚ÄúAn Airbus A350, for example, has five million parts and is built by hundreds of teams that are spread across four countries and more than eight factories. Companies routinely struggle to manage let alone make sense of the data involved in large projects. Foundry was built for them. The platform transforms the ways in which organizations interact with information by creating a central operating system for their data.‚Äù

Both of these systems solving big issues with less effort. The arms industry as example would took billions for drones and stuff in Syria for the same job. The important fact is that PLTR does not spend so much resources for new clients they only have to provide access and support for their services and the client feeding the ‚Äúmachine‚Äù with data.

The key point is to understand that PLTR benefits very huge from economy of scales. This is very important since their costs for additional revenue is basically flat while the profits growing exorbitant with new customers. They offer a software and platforms and not kind of services where they need man power. All they do is working on their platforms and improving it.

* **3. PLTRs big issue during the last decade**

Peter Thiel was a great supporter of Trump and funded his elections campaign. The market thought that when trump wins then PLTR will get all the government (especially military) contracts.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/peter-thiel-bet-donald-trump-wins-big.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/peter-thiel-bet-donald-trump-wins-big.html)

But this didn‚Äôt happened. Peter got cucked by the huge authority apparatus in pentagon. These dudes loves bureaucracy and they do it for a good reason. If you retire from your job in pentagon you usually get a high paid luxurious position at Lockheed, Raytheon or Bae Systems to make additional free money for your retirement. Many thousand people working in pentagon just to select and buy stuff for the government. They spending billions of dollars for purchases and then PLTR came around and said like ‚Äûlook guys we can do this job for a few millions instead billions‚Äú. Of course the arms industry was pissed and the pentagon boomers helped them out. PLTR got constantly scammed from boomers and didn‚Äôt get the contracts. This was also the ‚Äûswamp ‚Äûtrump was talking about.

A fun fact to this matter: Before James Mattis got summoned as the Defense Secretary of the USA he was a general in Afghanistan. He ordered services from PLTR despite the fact the pentagon was against it. But the marines praised PLTRs software and valued it over the trash they used to know from the defense/arms industry.

Even with a James Mattis as the defense secretary, trump as president and regardless that PLTR does it better and cheaper than the arms industry, it wasn‚Äôt possible for PLTR to get the government contracts.

[https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/11/palantir-defense-jim-mattis-inner-circle-239373](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/11/palantir-defense-jim-mattis-inner-circle-239373)

How it‚Äôs ended? Well Peter‚Äôs wife doesn‚Äôt have a boyfriend because Peter is the fucking boyfriend of their wifes. All ended at the court and PLTR won. All this injustice ended at the court. The judgements on these cases are true circuit breakers for PLTR. Not only because PLTR spent shit tons of money for law suits. The lawsuits were perfect uppercut hits on the arms industry and they ended some fraudulent behaviors and ‚Äûbest practices ‚Äûin the government

[https://www.defensenews.com/land/2016/10/31/judge-rules-in-favor-of-palantir-in-lawsuit-against-us-army/](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2016/10/31/judge-rules-in-favor-of-palantir-in-lawsuit-against-us-army/)

PLTR will profit from a Biden who wants to decrease the military expenditures. They will get the job done and at the same time the costs will go down. With the recent judgements the door looks open.

&#x200B;

* **4. Valuation problems**

I could spam some multiplication on revenue or even a DCF but I think it‚Äôs not necessary. Expect the costs of research and development (maybe marketing) the costs of PLTR stood mostly flat in the last quarters. It‚Äôs a growth stock and the pricing is mostly in the perspective of PLTR. This is actually all we need to know that the revenue increases while the costs staying mostly flat. Check out the balance sheets at page 12 on the S Form 1.

Let‚Äôs talk about the market. The whole market seems overpriced but it isn‚Äôt tbh. Due to the low cost of capital there is no alternative than to throwing your money on stocks or on real estate. There is nothing with a solid interest rate around (not even in emerging markets). At the stock exchange like in 70s, the companies had to offer a return, a perspective which should be more attractive as putting your money on a saving account with 8% interests without risks. These times are gone since the 2000s. So before people discuss insane valuation they should check out the fiscal and economical policies.

Now back to PLTR and why the price is difficult to set (cheap imo). First of all PLTR did a direct listing without an investment bank for their share offerings. Its lacking of the valuation which they usually would get through such a process.

PLTR wanted to do IPO with Morgan Stanley but it was mess.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-04/morgan-stanley-s-long-romance-of-palantir-pays-off-as-ipo-nears](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-04/morgan-stanley-s-long-romance-of-palantir-pays-off-as-ipo-nears)

Morgan Stanley proved themselves many times as stubborn communists when it comes to valuations. I mean you guys remember their disgusting price targets for tesla like 100$ post split or stuff like that.

These guys are very focused on numbers and I know it‚Äôs difficult to price in the potential and perspectives. But you can‚Äôt ignore these things for a fundamental valuation. If you want to consider these things in the price you have to understand the business of the company.

This ended that one team at Morgan Stanley valuated PLTR with 5 billion while another team thought they worth 40 billion.

[https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/11/14/palantir-ipo-valuation-morgan-stanley.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/11/14/palantir-ipo-valuation-morgan-stanley.html)

How is this difference possible and why is this happening? Because people don‚Äôt understand what they are valuating. This happened a lot in the last decade because the decision makers in these banks and many analyst don‚Äôt have any idea which metrics they should use on companies like that. They are using the metrics from classical industries on new business. They freaked out when Facebook was valued with 100 billion as IPO. Same with Twitter and in the last years it was Tesla. They said apple going to tank every damn year in the last decade. I honor Warren Buffet so much since he has the dignity to realize that he don‚Äôt understands something but at the same time he sees the potential and the trend. That‚Äôs why he hired 2 Chads who bought Snowflake for him. The transformation and the generation change didn‚Äôt happened yet. That‚Äôs why they try to use the metrics from Caterpillar on Tesla.

Guys the whole market is mooning with the cheap liquidity. Pennystocks and zombie companies transforming into billion dollar market cap companies. Facebook as IPO had a market cap of 104 billion back in 2012. At that time it wasn‚Äôt possible for Facebook to monetize their users with selling ads. They just paid 100 billion for the potential in more difficult market conditions.

Look at the IPOs like doordash, Bumble. I‚Äôm not going to call this a bubble. Just check out their business cases and use the metrics. Maybe its easier for people to understand Bumble and Doordash‚Ä¶

On page 12 of the S1 (balance sheet) Form you can already see the huge positive trends in PLTRs revenue and their costs. All this without all the positive events and contracts PLTR recently got.

PLTRs valuation is difficult and I think it‚Äôs miscalculated by pessimistic communist who don‚Äôt understand that their products are game changers for industries, governments and defense forces. Because of these points I think there is huge price potential for PLTR

&#x200B;

* **5. Risks for PLTR**

Despite the general market risks PLTR mentions at page 29 of the S1 Form the competitors as the main risk: ‚ÄúWe face intense competition in our markets, and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position.‚Äù The S1 Form didn‚Äôt aged well. Actually I don‚Äôt think that PLTR would have any trouble with offering new shares. Also with Peter Thiel as one of the founders the financial side should be stable.

As PLTR competitor people use to mention IBM. The boomers from IBM already surrendered with their Windows95 computers and decided to cooperate. The biggest threat would be big tech with big money like AMZN or APPL. You all now the stories about APPL and Spotify or AMZN and all the merchants. Even if the big players would step into PLTR markets it would be difficult for them since PLTRs products doesn‚Äôt rely on an Amazon store or on apple devices. PLTR is years ahead with their products.

I think the greatest risk (still) are the boomerish arms industry and all the boomers in pentagon and other authorities.

There are very corrupt infrastructures when it comes to decision making and assigning contracts. People fear changes but they can‚Äôt avoid the changes. With the recent judgements we can see a turn on the tables but the transformation will still take time. It‚Äôs a circuit breaker with an avalanche effect.

The risk factors on page 16 on the S1 form mostly aren‚Äôt relevant anymore. People complained that PLTR wasn‚Äôt profitable for 18 years. Well PLTR was never designed to be profitable and Alex Karp once said ‚Äúlove us or leave us alone‚Äù.

[https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/09/09/palantir-ceo-makes-livestreamed-pitch-to-investors.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/09/09/palantir-ceo-makes-livestreamed-pitch-to-investors.html)

But even this changed recently. PLTR became profitable in 2020 with 130,000,000¬ß. Now the same people complaining about how high the stock price compared to the profits. Well just you wait.

&#x200B;

* **6. Conclusion and Outlook**

If you still reading I have to admit that this was a lot text and i am sorry again about the lingo. Let‚Äôs connect the dots and bring this information to a point

1. The boomer coalition in the pentagon and in the arms industry is taken down by PLTR. They will able to get the governments contracts and the classic arms/defense industry is no match for PLTR products. The judgements of lawsuits were catalyst and the effects should be already shown in the next earnings. These were such underrated events but I think there still will be some odds but PLTRs situation is much better as it was a time ago. The chains are off!
2. Military expenditures rising worldwide

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qqcv8vzee4h61.jpg?width=744&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98d264f091b7ff80926038660f43c57b87fc8ef2

[https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2020/global-military-expenditure-sees-largest-annual-increase-decade-says-sipri-reaching-1917-billion](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2020/global-military-expenditure-sees-largest-annual-increase-decade-says-sipri-reaching-1917-billion)

With Bidens presidency we will see more disruptive technologies chosen by the government. Biden want to reduce the military expenditures. PLTR is able to provide better service for lower cost. Not only the recent judgements also the political change will help PLTR. Ironic if you remember that Peter supported Trump and getting his tendies from Biden.

3. PLTR superior products profits hugely from economy of scales. They don‚Äôt have any significant costs when they acquire new customers. Making the big data usable for decisions making is already very important and step by step people realize that this issue growing fast. We creating everyday more data than we did yesterday and leaving the majority of it as trace and unstructured data. We don‚Äôt work with it but big Institutions does.

Here is the passage from the S1 and I fully agree with it:

‚ÄúThe systemic failures of government institutions to provide for the public ‚Äî fractured healthcare systems, erosions of data privacy, strained criminal justice systems, and outmoded ways of fighting wars ‚Äî will continue to require both the public and private sectors to transform themselves. We believe that the underperformance and loss of legitimacy of many of these institutions will only increase the speed with which they are required to change.‚Äù

4. PLTRs value. The current situation of the market with tons of liquidity seems like a bubble. People don‚Äôt know what to do with the cheap capital and people throwing it even on meme pennystocks.

Facebook had his ipo back in 2012 during much harder market conditions as now. The valuation of Facebook was over 100 billion and people called it insanely overvalued. They did it because Facebook didn‚Äôt had a way to monetize their users (especially on mobile platforms). Facebook has a market cap of over 750 billion now and nobody calling it over valued.

A remember the recent examples? Bumble?! Bruuuh. Don‚Äôt get me wrong if you invested in Bumble but they have nothing special to offer and their business case can easily copied or improved by others. Its shows the current state of our market with the crazy liquidity that even zombie companies got astronomic valuations. Use these metrics on PLTR with great products, great management, low cost base and less odds as ever before‚Ä¶.

PLTR price is wrong imo especially in this market and with PLTRs current state and perspective.

5. Do you use PLTR? Me Neither! It‚Äôs not designed for us and we have to inform us about the success. PLTRs new contracts and their future are shining bright. With the settled lawsuits the sky is clear for PLTR. But their customer base is not only America. I‚Äôm not a murican and 3 weeks before I just find out that the police departments in our state using PLTR products. I don‚Äôt need to link endless evidences here since you can google it by yourself and see how many contracts PLTR recently got. Especially after the circuit breakers we talked about.

I have genuinely trust into Peter Thiel and Alex Karp that their will make the best of PLTRs potential. The odds getting removed and the demand for PLTR is increasing.

If all these information would priced in correctly we would have a share price of at least 60-70$.  With upcoming and ongoing positive events PLTR share price should soar more..

**What‚Äôs next?**

Now we have earnings ahead and the lock up period ending.

For the earnings I think the number will be fine and keep up the positive trend on revenue with a disproportionately trend of the costs. The most important part will be guidance for 2021. We should listen closely and see if the magic is already happening.

The second event is the ending of the lock up period. You all remember the end of the lock up period of Nikola? Just 1-2 days after they announced they don‚Äôt got the GM deal? The stock tanked ‚Äì for a good reason. You know the guy Trevor Milton.

But in PLTRs case everything is different. Despite the successful deals they got, does a guy who says ‚Äúlove us or leave us alone‚Äù sounds like someone who going to drop his shares at the first possibility? I don‚Äôt expect such a behavior from Alex Karp and neither from Peter Thiel. If some employees drop their shares it should be fine.

I would appreciate if the stock prices would go below 3√ü. It would create a healthy bullish chart pattern and would be actually a nice discount to get in or stock up. I don‚Äôt think that the shares going to dump a lot because of this event. The earnings and the guidance are more important and the key events if you want to invest mid ‚Äì long term.

What does all this means for you? Nothing! Please don‚Äôt do any market activity based on my DD. I‚Äôm just sharing my knowledge and looking for critics so I can reevaluate my theses. This is not a financial advice.

My hearts bleeding for all the GME holders. My last Reddit account got banned because I criticized ‚Äúthe pumpers‚Äù. In one of the comments I called the mods gay and got banned permanently (bye bye 20 k karma). If you are new to this please don‚Äôt do any decision based on this so I can sleep gladly.

I‚Äôm not well positioned and not trying to pump this stock. I have 70 shares and a CSP. Fair play and fuck all the bots and pump and dumper we recently got in the sub!

Leave an upvote if this post helped you. I need some more karma to be able to shitpost everywhere again!
