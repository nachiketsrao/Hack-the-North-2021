The fundamentals are good. They are making money, buying back their stock, and have two new interesting deals : one, with Tik Tok (which explains the recent push to $7) and another, w creating AI technology that allows for speech control-level-new-age-future-space-rockets entertainment type of experience. They just sent out a new satellite using a spacex rocket. 

Best of all.... TWENTY PERCENT SHORT!!!!! I repeat, 20%! It went up 5% this week, alone. 

Downside is they have 10bil in debt and the last two years have shown, though they make bank they actually havenâ€™t made a profit. This is because, though, Iâ€™d say, is because they bought Pandora for like 2 or 3 bil on 2019.

Pandora is, in my opinion, better than Spotify as a smartphone radio. Pandora is also pushing heavily to incorporate more artists and to become a better catering platform to these artists. In addition, the Tik tok deal immensely helps. 

These guys are undervalued. Now is the time. Call are cheap. The stock is cheap, and looks nice w those shorts on ðŸ‘€
