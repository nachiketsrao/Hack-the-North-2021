TL;DR: Ternium makes more than all of Yanksteel combined currently, has medium shart interest, a smaller market cap, AND it‚Äôs at the same fucking price as it was 3 months ago (due to funds like Citadel shorting) despite MASSIVE steel price increases and a ‚Äúfuck you, pay me‚Äù attitude. I intend to become rich off of this company.

# This week was crazy. Do you want to make more money? Are you tired of endless shart sqioizle squirt trash comments? Do your wives have DDs?

**If any of these apply to you, then keep reading.**

\*\*CLF is still primed and ready to launch, but let me introduce you to his Mexican brother $TX (Ternium).\*\*

# Where and what the fuck is TX?

Down in the lands of strippers, cocaine and cartels, TX produces flat steel and uses its own version of cocaine, coal coke.  Ternium is Latin America‚Äôs largest producer of flat steel and makes **more than all of Yanksteel (American Steel) combined**.

Consumer goods production has continued to increase in Mexico over the past 25 years with post-corona recovery already in play.

# Ternium & Tech:

[Both methods EAF and BF allow for multilevel steel production for all the lambos and shit that you want.](https://preview.redd.it/drxs6s5gbk471.png?width=851&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a9c949787566f94d7264c198445c58309260aaa)

TX takes advantage of more technologically advanced steel production methods that a lot of other companies including Yanksteel. After shamelessly stealing this image from u/JayArlington we can see a few different things. Using Electric Arc Furnaces (EAFs) **and** Blast Furnaces, TX maximizes steel production output. EAFs use scrap metal while Blast Furnaces directly cook iron ore to make steel that‚Äôs harder than your dicks when you see a ‚ÄúsHarT sQuEeZe‚Äù post.

Additionally, TX can be considered vertically integrated as they have a business dedicated to iron ore mining and production of something called Direct Reduced Iron (DRI), which can also be used in EAFs. The minimal waste of resources and maximized production is key to Ternium beating much of the steel industry.

Every single item you use from lambos, appliances, home goods, and even electronics need this steel.We can see the effects of inflation and these rising prices as used cars are somehow appreciating in value and construction costs are going vertical.

# Steel Goes BRRRRR:

As you know, the steel industry is booming right now. HRC futures prices (Hot Rolled Coils) are through the roof, with nearly every month through 2022 above $1000, a **50% increase** within the past 6 months. Because of both Buyden‚Äôs infrastructure talks and sustained global demand as China plays games with exports and imports, the steel industry **IS THE BEST SECTOR** from an inflationary and money making machine standpoint. Inflation is **not** transitory as JPOW keeps lying to us, but will have long term consequences as the money printer continues to go brrr too.

TX exports across the globe and operates specifically in Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, and Southern U.S.

**For the degenerates who actually use their brain cells, $TX is currently immune to tariffs.** The Section 232 tariffs the U.S. placed on steel do not apply to the rest of North America aka Mexico and Canada. This means that all the steel produced there can be sold at full premium.

If $TX is smart and follows through with opening an actual plant in the U.S. to pair with its U.S. operations, this would be in their best interest. As China continues to export less steel (with a potential export tax) and massive infrastructure plans about to be signed in place, $TX has a golden opportunity to produce massive steel dildos of profits.

# Financials:

**$TX was basically immune to coronavirus. You could give this bitch the Indian triple variant and it would still pump out profits like there‚Äôs no tomorrow.**

Argentina and Brazil continued to have strong construction and home demands, and as a result, in Q1 of 2021, Ternium had an **EPS of $3.07, a 45% increase from the previous quarter, beating estimates by 36%.** Just like every other steel company, TX is taking the ‚Äúfuck you, pay me‚Äù approach. As steel prices continue to rise, so does TX‚Äôs offering of flat steel. It‚Äôs like an infinite tendie machine.

\##**Analyst ANALysis:**

*‚Äú$TX (Ternium S.A.) has a Q2 2021 EPS estimate of $3.42 (only a slight increase over their Q1 $3.07 EPS number). This appears absurdly low which will mean another high percentage beat by $TX as analysts are surprised once again.‚Äù*  \- u/BlueWolf1983

Using some of his mathemagical skills, he determined that half of their Q2 sales should be based on previous Q1 prices. That appears to be somewhere in the $1200s. Assuming a Q1 2021 price of $1210 and an average Q2 2021 spot price of $1490, this would be a price of **$1,350 per ton**.

Again, based on these prices, he then calculated the following:

*‚ÄúIn the following chart, I've further added their cost per ton by taking the cost of their steel sales in Q1 of 2020 and dividing it by their total steel shipments. As they mentioned input costs would marginally increase, I've given that roughly a flat 5% 10% input cost increase. As on their Q2 call they mentioned input price increases lag due to existing inventory + reserves and as they mine their own ore, that should be sufficient.‚Äù*

&#x200B;

|Country|Shipments (in thousands of tons )|Q2 2021 Estimated Ton Price|Q2 2021 Cost Per Ton Estimate|Profit Per Ton|Total Profit (in Millions)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Mexico|1699|$1,350|$770|$580|$985.42|
|Southern Region|680.8|$1,210|$770|$440|$299.56|
|Other Markets|687.7|$1,100|$770|$330|$226.94|

*It appears they sell electricity in Mexico and Brazil as well. This is way too hard to try to figure out a Q2 estimate for. As this seems to range between 44M and 59M in profits for them, we will just add 50M to get a new total profit of:* ***$1,566.92M.***

Doing more math that went slightly over my head, the final EPS calculated should be: $**4.48.**

**This is all based on data approximately 1 month old, which means the EPS would likely be higher.** **From a conservative standpoint, this is another 35% beat of the previous quarter‚Äôs EPS.**

# Mega Shart Interest Stats:

**Currently, the shart interest on TX is ranging around 15%.** In the past month alone, the number of shares sharted increased by about 10%.

[Shart Volume Graph](https://preview.redd.it/72urus3obk471.png?width=892&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba20440bab38aff74777d66c2f4274ee8e572319)

# Here‚Äôs where things get interesting with the price action:

HOW is it that a company that is making **TRIPLE PROFITS** over the past 3 months due to increasing HRC prices, STILL AT THE SAME SHARE PRICE AS IT WAS IN MARCH. When earnings come out, $TX will blow through the roof and rest at its fair price of $55. But even now, it should be worth **ATLEAST** $42 at a minimum.

# AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST REASONS TO BUY:

[Citadel sCheMiNg](https://preview.redd.it/44h0yditbk471.png?width=846&format=png&auto=webp&s=deb5ae6d643514394671fb62a8bd2cb70f78b612)

**Citadel has been placing short positions on $TX since May,** which is the exact same time its price began to be suppressed. This isn‚Äôt some conspiracy or anything, just basing it on facts.

# üåàüêª Case:

The one thing I can see affecting profits is if cartels manage to take over the national government and seize control of the manufacturing industry. During the elections this past week, which also contributed to Mexican company stocks taking a dive, a lot of cartels were on assassination sprees.The political turmoil in Mexico could causes instability in the supply chain in the short-term. I don‚Äôt see this as a problem considering everyone needs steel and that cartels can‚Äôt drive the price downv just through political shenanigans.

# Conclusion:

# Ternium makes more than all of Yanksteel combined currently, has medium shart interest, a smaller market cap, AND it‚Äôs at the same fucking price as it was 3 months ago (due to funds like Citadel) despite MASSIVE steel price increases and a ‚Äúfuck you, pay me‚Äù attitude. I intend to become rich off of this company.

My Positions:

**10 contracts of 8/20 50C**

I will be averaging in with about 50 more contracts of the September 45Cs too.

Thanks to u/JayArlington and u/Bluewolf1983 for data and inferences made throughout this post.

Thanks to u/Dan_inKuwait for helping get this approved.

**TL;DR**

**If you like money,  buy into steel or $TX. Otherwise, all I can say is, enjoy being a poor.**
