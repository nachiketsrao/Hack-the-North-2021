  

I know why you are here. You are scrolling past all these degenerates YOLOing their money on CLOV, and while they make bank, you sit there, scrolling, waiting for some fresh DD to roll off the WSB genius idea conveyor belt so that you can make your millions. Well, my smooth brained friend, my fellow ape, you are in luck, for I am your savior.

Now, a while ago, being the retard ape that I am, and after getting bored of high probability and risk-averse SPY credit spreads, I decided to look for something a little more extravagant for my risk appetite, just like you are doing now. So I am scrolling through WSB and stumble upon a DD of a stock with the ticker REE. Literally. The name instantly captivated me, mainly because I eat crayons with my morning shot of tequila. Yet, as I started digging, I realised that the potential that this company has extended past it's spectacular ticker. 

Here's the original DD that I am talking about:

Now, who the hell is REE you may be asking? Well, for that we have a company description, conveniently provided by Yahoo finance:   
 

'REE Automotive Ltd. operates in the e-mobility business. The company develops REEcorner technology, which integrates vehicle drive components, including steering, braking, suspension, powertrain, and control into the arch of the wheel. The company also develops REEboard, a flat and modular EV chassis. The company is headquartered in Herzliya, Israel.'

In short, REE automotive make a sort of base template that other EV manufacturer's can use in their vehicle models. I will link a video of what they do exactly below:

Anyways, the reason this company first appeared on my radar was because of PIPE, and this article is what grabbed my attention: 

[https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fool.com/amp/investing/2021/08/31/why-this-electric-vehicle-stock-crashed-35-today](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fool.com/amp/investing/2021/08/31/why-this-electric-vehicle-stock-crashed-35-today)/

A beat down of over 35% after the initial investors pulled out, and following a deal with Magna International too. Why they sold, baffles me. I wish I knew the answer to that question too. When I saw this, I ultimately saw this as a discount to the initial SPAC price, and it gave me enough confirmation bias to buy some calls, with roughly 5 month to expiration. I started to look at this as a small risky play, that could pay off big time, but could lose me just a little money. I was happy to risk this on a stock that had a price target of $15-$16 dollars based on analyst expectations.

As I began to dig deeper, I found that not long after I entered my position, the CEO and COO of the company bought $1.68 mil worth of stock. Here's the article:

Now I don't know about you, but for me this pointed all the signs towards the upside. Clearly the insiders know something is going down. Like the article said, insiders sell stock for many reasons, but they only buy for one. When I saw this article I decided to load up on more of the same contracts. Here's a more detailed news report of the insider purchases:

So what could this be? Why are the insiders, in this case top management, buying shares? Well, this is where my tin foil hat comes into play. Starting September 9th, the company is going to be attending a number of virtual conferences. Now I think, they intend to announce something big at one of these conferences, either a new partnership or some kind of new deal. One of the conferences taking place is the Morgan Stanley Laguna conference on September 14t. There will be big names attending this conference, like GE and Ford. Even if REE don't have a partnership coming up, they are bound to be spotted by someone there who would have use for the their tech.

Tl;dr: I think this is a great buying opportunity right now, not just in the short run, but in the long run. If there is really some kinda deal going down at these conferences, this is gonna be at $7-8 by the end of September. If not, I think we can get to $6.50 at least from people just picking up this stock on discount from it's SPAC price. Ofcourse the long term price target is $15-16, but I think it would be safe to say that this isn't happening for quite some time. If you are looking for a short term play with leverage, and without risking your shirt too much, you can get the Feb 18th '22 7.50 call, which gives you a lot of time to be right. If you wanna play the conferences specifically, there are more short term calls available, but I wouldn't buy them just yet, because theta is a bitch. Ofcourse you can be completely risk averse and buy shares, but come on, this wsb after all. 

Now, this is not financial advice, literally just speculation. Don't make impulsive decisions  do your own DD.

Edit: Just bought 1k shares on the same account as my calls. I'm balls deep in this stock now.

Edit 2: Apparently the short borrow rate on this is over 100%, as according to some apes. However I have no way of verifying this, so take this with a pinch of salt. Worst case scenario it has no effect on the already appreciating price. Best case scenario, if it's true and the shorts are forced to cover, we could see an acceleration in the upwards movement.
