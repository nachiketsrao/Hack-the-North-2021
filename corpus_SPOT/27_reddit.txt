'Twas the week we went nuclear, when all through the day

Not a creature was stirring, not even an ape;

Our portfolios were jacked to the tits with care,

In hopes that uranium would soon soar and flare;

The dipshits were all nestled snug in their beds;

While visions of spot prices danced in their heads;

A gamma ramp primed, a commodity mid-squeeze;

Market makers fucked, even Wall Street agrees!

When out in the markets, there arose such a clatter;

I checked my portfolio to see what's the matter.

And to my surprise, the stocks have since dipped;

Yet the apes were unphased, their call options gripped.

The day looking grim, we look to the distance;

Thank fucking god for Sprott's damn persistence.

They spoke not a word, but went straight to their work;

And filled all their holdings, then turned with a jerk.

They sprang to the market with cash in their hand;

And jacked up uranium, just as they'd planned.

I heard them exclaim, as the markets shut down;

"What's good motherfuckers?  We're still in town."
