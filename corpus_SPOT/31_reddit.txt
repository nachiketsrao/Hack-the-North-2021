# Corsair Gaming

The **COVID-19** has accelerated gaming activity and companies in this segment saw a dramatic **surge** in sales. I've been looking for a gaming company to invest in for a while now, and after extensive research, I realized that the best pick in this sector is **Corsair.**

With a market cap of **$2.71B**, **$1.7B** in sales (2020), and **massive revenue growth** in the past 2 years, **Corsair,** is the natural selection for those who are looking to add **gaming exposure** to their portfolio.

***Company's overview :***

*Th*e company designs and manufacture gaming and streaming products, **Corsair** offer their user a vast verity of products: gaming Keyboards and mice, headsets, audio equipment, gaming PCs and many more. **Corsair** operates in 75 countries and delivered 190M gaming and streaming products. The company's CEO - Andy Paul, is actually one of Corsairâ€™s co-founders (established in 1994).

***Company's Financials:***

**Corsair** reported **second-quarter 2021** earnings on August 3 before the market opened, with a **24% YOY revenue growth**, all thanks to the gaming segment - **40.9% YOY revenue growth** from gamers equipment sales and **17.6% YOY revenue growth** in the gaming components.

***But,*** investors must take into account that **not all roses** with **Corsair**'s financials, **Corsair's EBITA** grew only 4% YOY even though revenue grew 24% YOY. The main reason is an increase in logistics costs, including ocean and air freight.

The company's **revenue** reached in **Q2-2021** to **$472,903M** while the **cost of revenue accounts for 72% from revenue,** and **net income** reached only **$27M**, which is **6%** out of the total quarterly revenue.

**I**nvestors should also look at **Corsair's direct competition** financial healthiness, the $18B giant - ***Logitech ($LOGI)***, generated this Q $1.3B In sales and their **cost of revenue accounts for 55%,** which is a reasonable ratio in this segment, plus, **net income** reached to $186,641M, which counts for 14% out of the total quarterly revenue.

A small amount of cash on hand is another weak spot for **Corsair,** with only $134,572M, while ***Logitech*** has $**1.5B.**

***Company's*** ***Debt :***

**Corsair** downsized debt and other liabilities - but not significantly - YOY change of 3.3%, to $848,718MWhile ***Logitech*** managed to do the same but on a larger scale YOY change of 19%.

# My conclusion

>**Corsair** maybe don't have the best financials versus their competitors, but they defiantly have the growth, and a major fanbase, with Logitech focusing more and more on offices supplies **Corsairs** niche is much more special with plenty of room to run.  
>  
>the number of users in gaming and streaming industry has surged hysterically and CRSR is the first true omnichannel presence in the space.  
>  
>CRSR has built this omnichannel through acquisitions like elgato ,which sells pro-level quality products.  
>  
>I believe that with time **Corsairs** will  will be able to position themselves not only as a top brand among users, but also financially.
