An unheard of stock gets 20 posts in an hour. This is a red flag. Generally speaking, it takes time for an unconnected group of people to reach the same conclusion. If there are numerous posts about a stock with positions already secured, it is most likely a pump and dump. Remember that MM secure their positions prior to pumping them and you are most likely the target. If gain porn is posted that generally means that the gains have already happened and you are providing the base for an easy pull out (with my wife's boyfriend knew when to pull out). Do your own DD before jumping into any bandwagon.

Any other red flags to look for?
