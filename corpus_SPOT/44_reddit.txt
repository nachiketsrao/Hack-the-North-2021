The point Chamath Palihapitiya made about Tesla in the article linked [here](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chamath-palihapitiya-tesla-stock-price-target-elon-musk-net-worth-2021-1-1029941932) is that Tesla is ultimately going to be (or have a large focus on) energy storage and production.

You can already see an example of this with the South Australian (South Australia is a state in...the middle south of Australia) battery storage facility that was a great test run for his proposal and also mimics the plot of one of the evil guys in a Michael Keaton Batman movie oddly enough.

>Palihapitiya said that Tesla was a "distributed energy business" and that Musk was figuring out a way to harness energy, store it, and use it to help people to be productive and fight climate change.

The point about this is that decentralised energy generation and power storage offers a lot of benefits (noticeably reduced transmission loss) and if Elon is aiming big, and he is, he may well be angling towards a "Tesla Battery in every home" style scenario which while that will open up to competition, even a fractional market share of the *entire first world housing market* would be profitable beyond belief, and especially when you consider the main thing Elon is really, really, really, really, really, good at.

Getting government money.

Due to many governments being left leaning and environmental they'll slavish lap at his space boots to be the first to give him billions to do his ~~space bullshit~~ *genius clean energy programs* and ~~if~~ *when* those programs begin to roll out for clean energy generation and storage then the resulting *revenue* is going to exceed that of Wallmart eventually, and that doesn't include the vast and staggering increase in assets held.

And one the main key points is that Elon will once again spin this out of virtually nothing, getting the staggering fuckhuge government contracts and funding with very lucrative and generous clauses right up front.

So he doesn't have to worry about waiting for a profit, the ventures will be paid for up front and *then* generate profits.

Because of the environmental regulations and tax breaks, a decent analysis and extrapolation of this alone is going to lead to revenues in excess of $500bn within fifteen years, and Elon Musk won't just be a paper trillionaire, he'll be a cold hard cash trillionaire.

This is not money spun out of nothing mind you, this is him gaining control of the energy market and emerging energy storage market which may well causes some friction, but Elon will win that battle as he will have full government support.

tl;dr: Stonks always go up, but TSLA is ***FUCKING STONK*** and will go beyond moon to mars.
