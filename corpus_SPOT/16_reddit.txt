Ladies and gentlemen,

Check out today's update here: https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/

SPUT purchased another 500,000 lbs of Uranium on the spot market. The nominal spot price hit $42.50/lb today. See here: https://twitter.com/numerco/status/1436419285639995392?s=19

In case you've been living under a rock, this is a positive feedback loop that is definitely going to squeeze the ultra-thin uranium market. SPUT has no mechanism to sell the uranium, they just buy it and keep it off the market.

disclosure: I'm long $REDACTED URANIUM ETF, $REDACTED URANIUM EXPLORATION COMPANY, +some other penny trash
