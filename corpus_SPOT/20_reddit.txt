Hello All - We have a newly developing supply squeeze for the most precious Renewable Energy Fuel of all: Uranium.

Price of Uranium has skyrocketed 30% in the last month and show no signs of slowing down. One company alone by the name of "Sprotts" is responsible for most of the 30% run up. ONE company.

Their thesis is simple: buy up all the available uranium - which is in very low supply - and store it until they can force Utilities to buy the fuel at a much higher price.

Sprotts has used only **300m** to bring the spot price from 30 to 40.

"Sprott in particular, reports Financial Times, has "snapped up" 6 million pounds of physical uranium, worth about $240 million, over the past couple of months, bringing its total holdings to about 24 million pounds.

According to Bloomberg, that's equivalent to about 26% of all uranium sold all around the world in 2020. "

"Factor in the 16 million pounds of uranium held by London's Yellow Cake PLC and these two companies alone now have a stranglehold on uranium supply -- controlling about 43% of annual demand. (Although according to Financial Times, that demand is likely to more than double in size through 2030.)"

THE 9/10 AFTER MARKET NEWS - SPROTTS ANNOUNCEMENT: Theyâ€™ve announced they have received 1 Billion in extra additional funding for more purchases!!!

SPROTTS 2022 PLANS: Sprotts is in talks to list on US stock exchange. Strategy is to issue shares and take the proceed to accumulate even more Uranium.

2022 Listing would be a HUGEEE event

These two articles provide good information about this scenario unfolding and why one company alone has been able to move the market for this limited commodity
