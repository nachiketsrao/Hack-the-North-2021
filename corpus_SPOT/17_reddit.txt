Some opportunist have taken to treating this sub like their own personal robinhood account. Make no mistake **they are here to profit at your expense.** I’m posting this because being pumped and subsequently dumped sucks, it just feels bad man. I wouldn’t wish it on anyone.

So if you don’t want to end up a jerry smith holding the bag on limited edition Star Wars coins then watch out for these tells that you’re being pumped.

1. **Urgency**: Ever notice that that best deals will disappear if you don’t act fast? This is a classic sales trick used to pressure you into making a decision without thinking. It works for cars, clothes, gym memberships, and... stocks. *No one can predict the price of a stock for EOW, EOM, or even EOY.* Anyone claiming to is absolutely full of shit. 

2. **Fomo**: We love to see gain porn, that’s why we’re here right? For that sweet fat FIRE! But there’s a difference between bragging and goading. If someone posts their gains of 2000% and encourages you to get in on a stock at ATH ask them where tf their dd was at 10% or even 50%, crazy how we never see that. You’ve already missed out, there’s no point in worrying about what if’s, even if you bought it earlier it would’ve tanked anyway. Just focus on the next play and move on.

3. **Zero Doubt**: Only a sith deals in absolutes. Believe it or not there is risk in every play and real dd considers it and offers counter points or the likelihood of either scenario playing out. The OP of a pump will leave this out entirely and claim a “sure thing” because this is the only thing stopping you from yoloing your kids college fund. In the back of your head you’re thinking “what if it tanks” and the OP will call you an idiot for even bringing up the risks. You are if you think a stranger is offering a free lunch with no strings attached.

4. **Emotional**: Nothing screams desperation like an overly enthusiastic and defensive sales pitch. A good investment will be rooted in facts and the OP will discuss its merit like a newborn in Sparta. If they insult, go all caps, or go to other subs begging them to come here and down vote you... then find another yolo because this person is way too hungry for your money.

5. **Rando**: This should go without saying, but if the OP has a Reddit age of 2 weeks you should be wary of what they have to say. Some folks do have a track record around here and while that doesn’t mean much, it’s at least some credibility compared to the obvious pump and dump accounts spamming this sub.

6. **Everyone is piling in**: An effective pump and dump will convince nearly everyone, largely because they utilize all of the aforementioned tactics. Usually the naysayers get down voted to oblivion. But the obvious plays have either already had their run up or there’s a risk that isn’t being considered and it’s why the price is what it is. This is that classic tulip case study you always hear about, the masses piling into a sure thing that inevitably crashes.

This isn’t exhaustive and you probably won’t see everything in a post, but if you see 2 or 3 you should be prepared to get stuck holding a bag for years or possible worse. 

And yeah I know this is a Wendy’s casino, but in a casino your odds are what they are, other players aren’t allowed to use your money on their bets so they can instantly cash out. And yet that’s what’s happening here. The house already has an edge, don’t give your tendies to some stranger on the internet.

My position: all in on the house of mouse!
