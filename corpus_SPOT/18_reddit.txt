Right now the Hedges are in a bit of a bind. I'm not going to repeat all the excellent DD you can already read on the front page. I however will bring up some important thoughts about the publics' spending habits. Buying shares above $150 a share is very expensive for Joe America, average citizen who doesn't do a lot of investments. I have been floored by the number of people willing to spend their real hard-earned money on this movement so far. Congrats to you for keeping all of us afloat. 

We have all seen that VOLUME is very important for keeping GME share price up but volume is not necessary for the ladder attacks to drop the price down. So why haven't they run the price into the ground yet? Because they risk volume jumps. The moment this stock drops below $100/share dramatically increases its affordability. The cheaper it gets the more people will be able to justify adding more to their portfolios. This is exactly what the hedges don't want. They are already in a share shortage. The last thing they want to do is drop the price of GME so low that it causes a massive buying spree. 

So how do they fix this? They do it with FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt). They want the world to think the money train has left the station and all that is left is free fall. They want to crush everyone's spirit so that when it comes time to ground that price, no one will want to buy it. WE CANNOT LET THIS HAPPEN. We need to keep our heads high and TRUST that the short positions have not been resolved. We need to TRUST that the Hedges still have a ton of debt obligations that need to be rectified. Any time we see the share price dip below $100 I suggest buying every share you can get your hands on. I know I will. They will be testing the waters over the next few weeks just to see how much enthusiasm is left for this stock. The rollercoaster will get worse. and seeing red for days/weeks is a test of our collective willpower. 

DO NOT SELL WHEN IT JUMPS TO 800. Do not think this is some lucky fluke and to get out while the getting is good. This is WHAT THEY WANT. They want to crush you so that when they give you crumbs you jump on the chance to show some return. 

TLDR: HOLD, BUY LOW, HOLD until 10k 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

GME 600 @ 41

Edit3: Mark Cuban on his AMA just confirmed this: “So what to do ?
If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold. I dont own it, but thats what i would do.
Why ? because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work.
I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB.
I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use . Do you stay with RH , who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again, or do you as a group find a broker with a far, far, far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on Wall Street.”
