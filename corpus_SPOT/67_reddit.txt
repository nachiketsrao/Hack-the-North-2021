- They are sitting on ~$700M of unrestricted cash on their balance sheet.
- They're in the process of raising a further ~$800M.
- They have zero debt!

They’ve recently tied up with SAF Group - a Private Equity Firm to invest this raised capital to generate asymmetrically enhanced risk-return opportunities in the cannabis industry, in Canada, the US and Internationally. This puts them in such a sweet spot, allowing them to take over companies, capture worldwide market share and vertically integrate their business operations.

As well as being a premium cannabis operator, SNDL is focusing and strengthening its business model towards being a cannabis financier as well, where its able to deploy its capital into multiple market segments within the cannabis sector, across the globe. This is smart as it allows them to increase their exposure whilst minimizing risk. 

I was pleased to see the deployment of funds into acquiring Inner Spirit Holdings which is Canada's largest single brand retailer & increasing stake into The Valens Co. 

SNDL has attracted institutional investment including 

-POTX ETF holding more than 18 Million shares (2nd largest holding), 

-Morgan Stanley & Susquehanna Intl. both acquiring > 11M shares each. 

Plus millions more from: Citadel, Credit Suisse etc.

I’m looking forward to seeing how the management will invests the remaining funds, and I believe the path they’re following will propel them to the top of the chain in the cannabis sector.
