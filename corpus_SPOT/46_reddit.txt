**Part 1. Meme Status**

I've stated [elsewhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oib6l8/the_state_of_the_meme_a_ta_of_all_your_favorite/) the definition of 'Meme Stock' I use, but in short it is thus:

Meme-DDs get made & price goes up-->Options Wizards buy options & **Thing** happens-->idiots FOMO in at terrible prices, then diamond hand-->diamond hands result in higher-low-->repeat for next leg up.

Basically, there are two kinds of plays around here: True Memes and P&Ds. The True Memes have two distinguishing features: 1) the involvement of the Options Wizards who buy all those options forcing the MMs to hedge and causing the **Thing**, and 2) after the retracement, the price action stabilizes at a **higher-low**.

Obviously, this could all just be me seeing bunnies in every cloud. I'm naught but a simple man with his intentions writ clear upon his trucker hat, so take what you will from my ramblings. However, when comparing the likes of GME, AMC, BB and BBBY with things like RKT, CRSR, WISH, WOOF, etc, it appears there are some tickers that have the follow through after the initial push and those are what I'm calling the True Memes.

So, is CLOV a True Meme? Answer: **it's hanging on by a worn thread**.

It remains my contention that a higher-low is a requirement for the 'follow through' on these plays. After all, if the ticker returns back to its pre-meme price (which for many of these is the all-time low), or worse, goes even lower, what then did the 'diamond handing' accomplish? Answer: jack shit. Think of it this way: if a bunch of people flood into the stock and buy up enough of the float, supply and demand dictate that the price *should* stabilize at a higher-low. Yes, the stock market is full of fuckery and it's not as simple as all that, but if the price just slides back to the low, the simple conclusion is: there are not as many of you as you think there are.

Also, going back down to the pre-meme low, or worse, is about as demoralizing as it can get. Many so-called 'apes' are going to say 'fuck it, I was had' and dump their shares for a loss. Further, it is going to severally damage the image of the play, making it look like 'nothing more than another P&D.'

Of course, I could be proven wrong here. CLOV could fall down and put in a new all-time low before shooting the moon. Who cares if you're wrong as long as you still make money.

**Part 2. Cum-tastic Charts**

First, the daily chart with Cbass's patented horizontal lines:

[Clov-tastic](https://preview.redd.it/2p48jy2j27d71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b6072e7598b01fd3df17d33b2a42a28dd6ea97f)

My theory regarding the True Memes was not merely a higher-low, but that the higher-low should ***specifically*** be around the breakout level of the previous move. We are way the fuck under that, so I'm just gonna toss that one out the window because it both makes me wrong and fills me with regret. So I've just applied Cbass's Second Law of TA: When you're wrong, just move the lines until you're right again.

Last week, the ticker found some support at $8. Which is technically a 'higher-low', with the all-time low being $6.31. That's $1.69 higher. ***Impressive***. It was actually an obvious place to stabilize (for a few days). I mean, everyone and their mother knows the 92.5% Fibonacci retracement level is like, *totally* the real level and super-duper important.

Next up, I've prepared two charts in accordance with Cbass's First Law of TA: You can always find a chart & indicator combination to tell you what you want to hear.

[Sexy wedge breakout that totally means something](https://preview.redd.it/7l37izwj57d71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=81806c9a7a1da78f165d2caad87c6c85459b1073)

As you can see here, I found the **hidden** downward wedge that we've already broken out of, and therefore the next logical stop is $100/share. ***This is how TA is done***. I've seen some posts by some fucking rank amateurs that I'm pretty sure were referring to me when they claimed that there were people posting 'tons of shitty TA.' Bruh, you wish you had these skills. Cbass don't need no fuckin' Bollinger bands, Keltner somethings, so-called 'moving averages' or any of that fancy bullshit. I *could* do it all with horizontal lines, but look here, I figured out how to draw *other kinds of lines*.

Here's another example of my superior line-skills:

[Look at 'em skills and burn with jealousy](https://preview.redd.it/mstskgyi77d71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b988d3bf2c072f6e219e4dd7b95547e1bdd5ab4)

Here you can see we were in a downward channel from the beginning of the month and we're now not in ***that*** downward channel. Which means we **can't possibly** go down anymore. Again: $100/share imminent. Furthermore, the upper channel has clearly turned from resistance into support. Bruh, it just do get more bullish than this.

Except if I do this:

[Drawing a sad-face downtrend line](https://preview.redd.it/flgwlice77d71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=59d666de69e1bb228c5511f701266f7eb2a068a2)

Here, I just found a different line that maintains the bearish case. In this world, when the price gets back up to the red dashed line, it will be promptly rejected to $0. But I own this stock and this outcome doesn't make me any money, so for ***reasons*** this chart is wrong and we definitely do not exist in this version of reality.

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 3. Donkey Dicks**

Now, I've never done DD on anything until *after* I bought it. Thus, in keeping with tradition I've taken a cursory glance at the underlying company of this wunderkind of a ticker after finding myself down 40%. In short, it's ***basically shit.***

Someone right now is screaming Cathie Woodisms at their screen, like: **disruptor, innovator, AI, machine learning, tech, growth, next-gen**, etc. Dude, these guys sell insurance to old people. Worse, they only sell one kind of insurance: Medicare Advantage. Will they make money in the future? Yeah, sure. But there is no fucking universe where this narrow category of business is going to command a premium like Tesla or whatever the fuck Cathie is pumping these days. You can fantasize about the whole of the human species paying endless subscription fees for the privilege of being driven around in a self-driving Tesla that smells like someone had sex in the back seat. You're high, but it is *technically* possible. Clover Healthcare has a subset of the elderly in one country as their maximum consumer base. And the government has their hand in the mix.

"But they're saving the government money with their ***software platform***!" 1) The government doesn't actually give a fuck about saving money. If the past two years taught you nothing else, I hope this at least got through. 2) Calling a computer program a 'software platform' doesn't make it anything more than a program where you input information. Is it really that much more than a fancy version of Microsoft Excel? I doubt it, but maybe if they gamify the button clicking they can get people hooked with the dopamine effect. It just looks like advertising to me; kind of like when the term computer program got replaced with 'app' in order to make it sound like something more than just a program running on your phone. Whatever, before I ever get old enough to be on Medicare Advantage, I'm going out in a blaze of hookers and coke so I'll never get the chance to click those buttons.

CLOV gets compared to a lot of the mainline insurers, e.g., United Health Care (UNH). UNH has a market cap *literally* 100x CLOV, and yet people are like "CLOV totally ***deserves*** to be valued like UNH." UNH has an income of $14.5**B**. CLOV is at -$55**M**. Even sitting at a market cap of $395**B**, UNH is only running a p/e of 27.6, with a forward p/e 19.4. They are a massive company that offers all varieties of insurance and they are making fucking bank, thus their stock is steadily climbing to the moon. You can point at the 80/20 rule and make the case that it is responsible for the spiraling cost of health care in America and I'll nod my head and agree, but that does not mean CLOV is riding into this dusty town to save the day. They are in too narrow a category to have an appreciable effect on overall costs, in my opinion--assuming they have any effect at all.

"But Clover is growing at ***double digits***!" It's easy to grow double digits when you start with no customers. After 2023, I believe the estimate is 5-7% per year. It's not terrible, but it's not going to take you to the moon. If CLOV is able to expand out into the general insurance market and take away market share from the big boys, then okay, there's some case for the crazy valuations people are throwing around. But I've as much chance of snorting lines off the titties of a Victoria's Secret model while raw-dogging her on the hood of a brand new lambo parked on my yacht... anchored off the pristine white sand beaches of my new private island.

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 4. The Short-Term Gamble**

So, given that the TA on CLOV is a crap shoot (as all TA is) and the underlying company is less than amazing, why the fuck would anyone in their right mind buy this ticker. Simple: **gambling**. That is what CLOV was, is, and all it ever will be: a gamble. And *you came here gamble,* because this is the fucking casino. That's why I bought it. I was wrong about an immediate turn around after the first launch and so now I'm stuck sucking pond scum. Such is life.

Is the short-term gamble over? No, not yet. As the charts show, CLOV is bottoming out, which means the next direction ***should*** be up. Obviously, because it's gambling, down is possible, but nobody came here to hear that. Furthermore, CLOV remains one of the top tickers sentiment-wise. A lot of eyes balls has the potential to materialize that sudden move upward that everyone is pretending they're not here for. On top of that, the SI remains high. I think the importance of SI is way overblown, but most people think otherwise and that belief alone will drive retail toward the ticker. Finally, it looks like the Options Wizards took one shot at this thing (I don't know this for certain), and there is a chance they will come back around to it if things start moving up. Thus, there remains the potential for a second massive launch.

So let's assume someone is looking at this and thinking, "Okay, based on the charts I might take a stab at this." The next question is: Get in now, or wait for $7? This is impossible to answer, of course, but if you are like me, then if you buy now, it will drop to $7 because the stock market exists to fuck with you, ***specifically***. By the same rule, if you wait, then it will take off without you and you'll FOMO in at $25. Pick your poison.

Of course, my theory of these plays states a breakdown back to lows ends the play. If it does happen, I will obviously just revise my theory so that I'm still not wrong--because I do TA how it's supposed to be done.

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 5. The Long-Term Gamble**

Long-term, CLOV is still just a gamble. The delusional idiots will tell you this is a 'can't fail' investment. All investments can fail, including this one. People like the 'fall-back' position: i.e., I gambled on the short-term jump and lost, but that's okay because long-term this is a 100% winner. This is how you get ~~delusional bagholders~~ *a cult*.

At the current price level, is CLOV a good long-term gamble? It's the definition of mediocre. Will it be at $500 in ten years, 'because that's where UNH is now'? Not unless JPow initiates hyperinflation, in which case that new fleshlight you've got on your Amazon wishlist is going to be a $1000--so, you know, *bigger* problems. A more reasonable target is mid-20s (low $30s at best) within 2-5 years assuming there is no moon landing and the retail interest dies off and CLOV becomes just another ticker in the garden. The current 12-month average price target is $10.30.  Again: **This is gambling**.

There are a bunch of believers for this stock (like any ticker that gets its own sub reddit), and I think if we end up in the long-gamble, much like poor Lord Stannis, they will be in for some disappointment.

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 6. And now my Watch has begun**

I'm a bagholder. I'm not gonna lie about it, bullshit you, tell you I'm happy about it, or claim I've discovered the secret to curing your financial woes. Much like Stannis, First of His Name, Rightful King of the Seven Kingdoms, I thought I was to be the savoir of my own story and yet here I am, freezing my balls off at the Wall with a bunch flee-ridden dudes and an old lady in magic makeup, waiting to see if the cold or the ice zombies kill me first.

As you can see from my positions below, I'm not in the worst spot--not in the best, either. My odds of break-even are pretty good. I might have to wait two years to get there, but I think I'll get there even if CLOV falls off the face of the internet. My odds of doubling my money are okay, if I'm patient enough. Which I won't be... obviously. Odds of 10x in 10 years *without* the Wizardry: 0.1%, ***exactly***. Like all my trades, my entry into this position is full of shoulda, coulda, woulda's. So it is with us all.

Sunday addendum:

I woke up this morning in a cold sweat, beset by the terrible realization that I had neglected to mention the single most important reason to buy CLOV:

Jim Cramer said [don't buy it](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/21/cramer-lightning-round-nokia-is-a-buy.html). He called it a "two-leaf clover" and said you should buy UNH instead. Pfff. Who the fuck would do that? He also called NOK a buy, so definitely buy CLOV instead NOK.
