Did you come to Wallstreetbets today looking for nudes of Cathie Wood? Well, you're a weirdo. But I've put together the next best thing! A low-effort, mostly bullshit TA/DD of randomly selected things she may or may not have ever owned. Replete with Cbass's patented horizontal lines and accompanying jocularity. All in an unnecessarily long format so you have something (else) to complain about today!

**Part 1. The Great Woodening**

Cathie's Ark funds have been around for a while now. I know, I lost money on several of them back before she blew up. Keep this little tidbit in mind as you read on, as there are few things as effective at coloring one's views as the bitterness of missing the boat.

Over the past few years, Cathie blew up on the spot. So much so, that she gave birth to entire youtuber carriers. These guys just put on 'youtube face' for the thumbnail, add a title like 'What Cathie JUST bought!' (always important to all-cap the 'just'), and then they read out information you could've just gotten by signing up for her trade notifications yourself.

So how did this come to be? How did this random lady with a questionable investment fund portfolio get dubbed '**the money tree**' by the Koreans?

Answer: She's a fantastic salesperson with accesses to the **full** range of media in order to execute her pumping strategy. And... she bought Tesla. And then pumped the absolute shit out that motherfucker.

You see, her pumping strategy is ***several orders of magnitude*** better than anything you'll ever see here, because she backs her pumps up with next level YOLOs. In order for one of you ~~retards~~ *distinguished investors* to even approach her level, you need the best DD known to man ***and*** you need to follow that post up with a YOLO post were you bought ***tens of millions*** of dollars worth of the stock. And even then, you'd fall horribly short of what this lady can do.

Does this mean I think she's a scam artist? No. Is she running a game? Aren't we all? But I'll get to that more in Part 6. On to the Charts of Fury!

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 2. A Wooden Albatross**

The greatest decision Cathie Wood ever made was to buy Tesla and pump it harder than any stock has been pumped in the history of pumping. I haven't investigated her past enough to know whether she was captain of the cheerleading squad, but good lord, she *should've been*.

The current state of TSLA:

[Elon's back on track](https://preview.redd.it/tqvmp0b04te71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=f06f3e05363260b81cb9a83a745d708b65236332)

A couple of important points about this chart. First, it's still over that green uptrend line, which is decidedly bullish. Second, it broke out of the orange downtrend line. Again, bullish. The only worry I have is that there is a sideways channel forming. However, this uncertainty should resolve itself by the end of this month (August) at the latest.

&#x200B;

Before shitting all over TSLA, let's first compare it to ARKK:

[Should've just bought TSLA](https://preview.redd.it/8ollr3bn4te71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=b67e0273de08a10972ab8b504df1e24d08001d31)

Here we can see that Cathie is under performing her own major holding. And TSLA is far and away her largest holding (some of the other big ones are down below). She holds TLSA as her number one holding in ARKK, ARKW **and** ARKQ (over 10% in all three). If you wanted to outperform Cathie Wood, all you had to do was just buy TSLA yourself. (The percent difference *down* from the top is nearly the same, however, TSLA is *up* 400% from the same point versus her 150%). Why pay her to do it for you? To be fair, she does have other stuff and it's not all bad. However, I named this section the Wooden Albatross because her position here is so large that **as Tesla goes, Cathie goes**.

Which brings me to the problem with Tesla: ***competition***. Tesla was a great investment. Elon got out front of everyone with EVs, proved the doubters wrong, and has reaped outsized rewards for it. But the competition is coming for him. It might not be this year, or even the next, but Tesla ***is going to bleed***. Mark my words, it is going to happen.

With excellent earnings, Tesla is bringing that stratospheric p/e of over 1,000 in 2020 down to something more '*reasonable*' of \~230 for this year, and by 2022 to \~130. That's great. **However**, in order to keep up, Elon is going to need to keep smashing out of the park again and again and again and again and.... You get the point. One miss and this puppy is going for a ride down blood bath mountain.

Still, the chart says up, and I'm by no means bold enough to call the top on Tesla. Tread carefully, friends.

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 3. Back to the Future**

If Cathie is known for anything (other than buying Tesla) it's what I like to call 'Cathie Woodisms.' This is a whole universe of new age buzzwordology such as: innovator, disruptor, AI, machine learning, next-gen, etc. Now, I've pointed and laughed at this shit on a fair number of occasions here on the sub. But I also wrote [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ousepa/the_roaring_2020s_why_the_mother_of_all_crashes/), where I made the case that this shit will underpin what I've dubbed **M.A.Rs** **- the Mother of All Rallies**.

Now, what at first blush looks utterly inconsistent, after the application of contorted logic becomes totally consistent! These buzzwords are, ***for the most part***, bullshit and just slapped on any old thing in order to make the pump sound better. However, there are some cases where I think these appellations are more than just sound bites, but represent something truly new. So let's look at some of Cathie's investments that meet that criteria (at least in my eyes).

First, and probably the best, CRSP:

[Not a great chart, but I want that third arm](https://preview.redd.it/ldkkwbr59te71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3289a6dfc74a66ca54b5a0190ce3a5bcf510b99)

The CRISPR gene editing tool is most next level shit that exists today. Sure, the present applications are limited and for the foreseeable future this will be constrained to dealing with genetic disorders (which should bring hope to you all). The potential of this, however, is truly mind bending. You could no longer be a manlet, for example. You could no longer have to suffer having a woman laugh at you when she sees how small your penis is and ask, "Is that *really* it? I guess I get to sleep through this session..." I get to have my 20-year-old hairline back. ***Possibilities***.

If this leads where I'm thinking it leads, then we are in for borderline miracles here, people. Now, just because *this* company has CRISPR in the name, does not mean it will end up being the Chosen One. But for now, let's just say it is. If you're looking for an entry, this is kinda, sorta settling into a channel and is at the bottom of that. If you're a ***believer***, TA doesn't matter; buy it at any price. I regret not picking it up at that dip under a $100.

&#x200B;

Next up, the embodiment of evil, PLTR:

[The Eye of Darkness sees .... a 'maybe' uptrend](https://preview.redd.it/2r1mpc21bte71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab25127dfa2315936f5ab4a26f72266bfdf0c06d)

Palantir is difficult to wrap your mind around, but basically they do AI shit, specifically data analytics. While this seems ho-hum, I'm told that it is in fact the precursor to ushering in Big Brother and giving **all the power** to our Totalitarian Corporate Globalist Overlords. Which both gives me a hard on and makes me want to buy the stock. I mean who wants to be on the team with the tiny little hobbits when you can be on the team with the hundred-story high flaming eyeball? Have you guys seen how the Globalist Overlords live? I have it on good authority its just like the rich asshole bad guys in every Gundam series. Man that looks awesome.

As for the chart, it's finding its way into a channel, but there's also support trend line underneath us right now. I think it's a buy at these prices, personally. Though I haven't actually bought it, so you know.... Like CRSP, I think Cathie is right on this one and it's a good ***long*** hold.

&#x200B;

Now let's look at something Cathie was absolutely fucking ***wrong*** on, WKHS:

[Dead-ish Horse](https://preview.redd.it/dgcoewescte71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cade3c1428ee8da90fa816f527f849d258d69e9)

This is my third time talking shit about this ticker so I'll keep it brief: **I don't like it**. Nothing they do impresses me. The problem is that anything they do, someone else does better. Drones? Amazon. EVs? Tesla. They are so unimpressive that even Cathie bailed on them, as she no longer holds any shares of this amazing buyout opportunity of a company.

From the chart, again I'm seeing a potential channel forming, which is *amazing* news for the bagholders.

&#x200B;

Next, and because I'm a whore for karma, HOOD:

[What TA!](https://preview.redd.it/4apb6z1udte71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=3694002b6d5912eaa9ec3710f3d81a707c0d3cce)

Okay, this is basically a joke chart. Doing TA on a ticker two days on the market is like deciding to marry that kinda chubby girl on your second date because she promised she was working real hard to slim down. And now you have special van to carry her around and can't own a house with more than one story. I'd say more about HOOD, but I don't want to incur the wrath of the **Titans of Wall Street**.

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 4. Hardwood Flooring**

Under girding Cathie's ~~degenerate gambling~~ *wise, forward thinking investments* are some pretty solid companies. Indeed, there are too many to cover here, but to give you an idea: **she owns John Deere in her space fund ARKX**. (And her robotics fund, though it makes more sense there as Deere is likely moving toward self-driving tillage equipment). She also owns all kinds of other 'boomer' stuff (e.g., GOOG, AMZN, etc.), so I'm going to limit this part to the other three of her top holdings in ARKK after TSLA.

&#x200B;

First, the second major holding, TDOC:

[That whole re-opening thing in chart form](https://preview.redd.it/k0hfqxe5gte71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c6edb9ddba318a1bc93e07bd59390d47db906e6)

So this tele-medicine company has performed as expected after the lockdowns ended: *poorly*. In addition to ARKK (2nd largest position), she owns this in ARKW (#3), ARKG (#1, to be expected), and ARKF (#15). She sure likes this stock. I don't know all the much about it, but its recent under performance is certainly dragging her down given its position among her family of funds.

From the chart, we have a pretty clear downtrend channel. The sliver of hope would be the support line I drew, but it's way too early to call the bottom here. I'll not be buying this at these prices (or ever, if I'm being honest).

&#x200B;

Next, something people around here actually know about, ROKU:

[Nice chart, 9\/10, would fuck](https://preview.redd.it/hcm8mebchte71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=040eddc1c05adcbf6e258154597e8fdb1b7c8712)

I'm seething with regret that I passed on this ticker ***several times*** back in 2019. Cathie's not, though. This is one of her better performers, if not the best given it's #3 position in ARKK. I still don't like the company because I don't see how they're going to beat out Amazon, Netflix, etc. But given how horribly wrong I've been thus far, you should definitely not listen to me.

But if you wanted to listen to the chart, you'd wait for a retrace to the uptrend line. The ticker might not give you that, though. With that double top, however, I think more likely than not, *it will*.

&#x200B;

Lastly, some fin-tech magic, SQ:

[The definition of showing up after the party's over](https://preview.redd.it/iedoxkj1ite71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=71bbc455f0b4d93df3d14b88b4651fe4a2d6f606)

I never even heard of this until it was way too fucking late to buy it, so again Captain Sour Grapes has little good to say about it. I do understand what they do, because my nephew works at a restaurant that uses their app for payments. There are others in this space, but the chart says people like Square's chances and I'm not going to argue with that.

On the other hand, we're clearly out of the channel and there is no hope of recovering **that** channel. In keeping with Cbass's top notch TA skills, I eyeballed a rough sideways channel, but just going straight the fuck up from here is just as likely. (Probably in a new parallel channel). Still, this has the shape and feel of a typical big-tech chart: run up, pause for hot sideways action, then resume the run up. I'll not be buying it, I think, but y'all have fun with it anyway.

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 5. Cathie & the Chairman**

Cathie's been in the news lately for dumping her Chinese positions. She's certainly not alone in this and if you take the general pulse of investors vis-a-vis China it's.... let's just say ***not good***. I'm going to constrain myself to just her positions, rather than pile on this orgy of 'go fuck yourself.'

First off, she's fully out of Tencent (she dumped the last on Friday, but it's not yet reflected in the holding lists on her website). I won't show the chart because this ticker is on OTC, so I think that's a no-no 'round these parts. There's some other shit she's selling too, but ~~nobody's ever~~ *I've* *never* heard of it.

One of her larger positions that she's still unloading is JD:

[Maybe Xi destroys you, maybe he doesn't... it depends on how his breakfast was](https://preview.redd.it/imq7835hlte71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=426c7630ae777261d97a8f37ef08a575b67520c5)

JD is an online sales company like Alibaba or Amazon. It's #2 in China, I believe. I haven't heard any bad news specific to this company, but the general crackdown has hit the whole sector, no exceptions. The chart gives you a maybe-channel to work with if you've got the testicular fortitude for this kind of gambling. It is $10/share back to the top of that channel.... Or a complete breakdown a couple weeks from now when news breaks that the entire board of directors got sent to a gulag.

&#x200B;

I haven't seen any news of her unloading the magic carpet, BABA:

[This looks FINE! \(Weekly candles\)](https://preview.redd.it/qehlylrcmte71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=20b50a35e7cb5bcf7c91c9570ac9b69291f6e876)

But it sure is unloading on her, right in the face. Fuck me, this is a nasty chart. You can tinker around with that downward channel all you like and it's never gonna look like anything other than you losing more money.  The $180 mark is your beacon of hope, because after that I don't see all that much in the way of a slide all the way to $130.

&#x200B;

Let's take a look at the daily chart, just for fun:

[Yep, still looks bad](https://preview.redd.it/qzs8yizwmte71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cd95571285e835337935af6a7c79857a0f984c)

You see, by making this chart that doesn't show anything under $170, that means the price ***cannot go under $170***. This is because charts are magic spells that you cast on the ticker. Try it out next time you're losing all your money!

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 6. Romancing the Wood**

Looking at her recent under performance, one must inevitably ask: Has Cathie Wood lost her touch? Or perhaps: Was it nothing but luck all along? There's no easy answer here.

Without a doubt a cult of personality has risen up around Cathie and that has helped her outperform, as hordes of retail investors decided to buy into whatever she was buying into. Indeed, ***this very processes*** appears to be part of her strategy: i.e., she buys a new, 'innovative' company, goes on CNBC to talk about, then all the youtubers make videos about it and the subs dedicated to her start talking about it, and boom, just like that she sent the ticker to the moon.

Despite this, I don't think she just some charlatan. Some of her choices are questionable, certainly, but others indicate to me that she is doing exactly what she claims: investing in the companies of tomorrow. It is simply that she, like any human being, can be wrong. And sometimes, *horribly wrong*.

I'm not going to make a snide comment about how she came to her idea for these types of investment funds. The younger version of Cbass wore that cloak of sneering superiority, and doffing it was one of the better character choices I've ever made. Perhaps the only good one. People like to snicker when someone describes their epiphany in religious terms, forgetting that every human until these most recent times did exactly that whenever an idea came to them.  I'll say no more.

As for whether her idea will work out for her, that has yet to be decided. As I've seen others here note, she appears to be trying to play catch-up, afraid that her recent slips will trigger a rush to the gates causing the collapse of her whole endeavor. This is a real danger for her, but doubling down like a degenerate gambler at 5:00 am in the casino is probably the wrong call. To that point, I'm actually happy to see her selling, even for a loss. For a while there, it looked like she was going to just keep buying into failing positions, hoping her very act of buying would be the thing that re-ignited the play.

Now, our old buddy Jim Cramer sure does like to talk about Mrs. Wood. Some have called him all sorts of names for his seeming obsession with her, but I rather think he saw what she was doing with her purchase-and-pump routine and it *irked* him. This is his game, too, but in Cramer's mind he only pumps 'responsible' plays, while Cathie is pumping crap.

Or maybe Jim was just trying to Romance the Wood:

[Good luck Jim!](https://preview.redd.it/qsap2lax0ue71.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be0e0cbfd1ee6ceaba5ded01887a1229f07df2bb)

&#x200B;

***Good luck, and may the lambos be with you.***

&#x200B;

I've no positions relative to this post, but here's the **Portfolio of Destiny**:
