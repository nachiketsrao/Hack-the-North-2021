A new player is in the Uranium game, its name is Sprott Physical Uranium Trust (SPUT). What is it? It is an ATM used to buy millions of pounds of Uranium in the spot market. Why is this a big deal?

Utilities. Utilities have been sleeping at the wheel and enjoying these Uranium prices at record lows. Instead of signing long term contracts, they buy Uranium off the spot market. Mines do not like this because it means they have to close down mines since it is simply not profitable to continue them.

Uranium is a small market. Significantly smaller than silver and gold. Nearly all uranium that is bought is used, this means you can’t easily manipulate it. Since Sprott started up their ATM, they have bought 6 million pounds of uranium in 3 weeks. On the current trajectory they will buy 104 million pounds of Uranium in a year. This is almost the ENTIRE uranium supply for 2021. The Uranium supply is only around 134 million pounds. And mines take a while to start back up to meet demand.  If you look below you can see current demand is not met with current supply because mines have had to stop because the price got too low.

One of the largest Uranium producers has no intention of increasing production for a couple years. In fact, they are also buying on the spot market to meet demand.

What is the play?

As Sprott starts to by up uranium and take it off the market, the utilities are caught with their pants down. They used the spot market to enjoy low prices but because of this some don’t have long term contracts and many are starting to expire. They need to compete with the ATM Sprott has and the supply side won’t be fixed for a while.

Buy up U.UN. This lets Sprott issues shares and use the money to take uranium off the spot market.

JUST NOW: Sprott Just increased their ATM to buy 1.3 billion worth of Uranium. This is up by 1 billion from their original of 300 million 3 weeks ago.
