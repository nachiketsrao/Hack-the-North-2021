 

A lot of us were shocked about the 19 million Fails-to-Deliver that were exposed on our last bi-weekly report, but not the GHOST! I have recognized patterns, since late May and have felt compelled to show my findings in the past. I know the overall feeling within this sub went from "when lambo", to "is a squeeze still in play???" Well I'm here to tell you, squeeze or not, CLOV is a fucking winner in the long haul, but also yes a SQUEEZE is most certainly still in play!

* First things first, yes dark pools are real.
* Yes HF'S buy on dark pools, and yes they sell on the LIT markets.
* Yes this absolutely has an negative overall affect when it comes to CLOV's current price per share!
* Yes eventually, this will cause a SQUEEZE. How much of a SQUEEZE, is anyone's guess!

**My Rinse and Repeat theory has been discussed in the past, but lets recap.**

*Every other week*, prior to the reports being made public, we have seen a trend. CLOV turns green, before eventually losing its steam mid week. Then Fridays close happens to fall short of MAX PAIN (Where the highest amount of *IN THE MONEY CALLS* lie).

The report from fintel referenced in the above link is released on or around the 2nd and the 17th of every month. The data provided from fintel I will focus on is Fails-to-Deliver (FTD). This data is extremely delayed for us as is. Therefore it's impossible to figure out exactly where we are today! IMO, this is not by accident. FTD has a major role when it comes to short squeezes!

* The most recent report came out on 8/2, and covers FTD up to 7/14. Now I asked the question in my last post, *"Are FAILS-TO-DELIVER why we saw a jump on 7/12th?"* Now based on our most current report, released on 8/2, the answer is as simple as YES! But I'll break it down on how we come to this conclusion.
* The Fails to deliver reported on **fintel** for Friday, **July 9th** totalled **12,701,181**. The price per share they have listed is **9.36**.
* **9.36** is what Thursday, **July 8th's** price was at close. This means we can assume the **12.7+** million shares reported on July 9th, is in fact, how many shares were considered Fails-to-Deliver at the July 9th's OPEN.
* Come monday, the **12th of JULY**, the **FTD** were reduced to **11,461,074**. The price per share they have listed is **9.27**.
* Again, we can assume 11.4 million shares were considered FTD at the **OPEN** of Monday, **July 12th**. Friday, the **9th** of **JULY,** had a closing price of **9.27**.
* This brings me to the conclusion of my question above! Are fails to deliver why we saw a jump on the **12th of July**!? YOU GOT DAM RIGHT!!!
* CLOV closed **July** **12th** with a price per share of **9.68**. The reports issued by fintel for whatever reason skip the **13th of JULY**!?!?!?!?!?!?! See for yourself below!
* The price showing for **7/14 is 8.91**. Which is the price at close on 7/13! The FTD reported is 141,301??? They covered over **11,319,773** shares between Monday the **12th** and Tuesday the **13th**, which just so happens to be missing from fintel???

WHY IS 7/13 MISSING???

LETS DISREGARD THE MISSING DAY FOR A MOMENT!!! (I know this will be hard to move past, but please carry on).

Here's the deal. If you look above at this image you will see yet another trend when it comes to the timing they reduce their shares shorted!!! Its clear!!!

1. HF's used to be able to reduce the Fails-to-Deliver in a day or two!
2. As HF's continue to rinse and repeat when it comes to FTD, they are in need of two things to occur.
3. First HF's need to purchase shares, in order to return shares to MM'S, so they can reduce the number of FTD. If they don't purchase shares over time, they risk momentum taking over!
4. Next they have to follow up with shorting the stock all over again in order to suppress the stock price, which in turn ends up adding back to the total FTD!
5. Remember T-3. (HF's have 3 days to return these naked shorts to avoid a penalty, and they must also keep calls *OUT OF THE MONEY* in order to refrain a gamma squeeze!
6. It isn't working. The FTD are reaching highs every other week before they reduce them prior to reporting. (19 million last report, and 5 million the report prior)
7. Hf's used to reduce them on a Monday. Then they had to reduce the FTD on a Monday and Tuesday, or momentum was getting out of hand. Which makes it harder for them to suppress the stock price by the upcoming FRIDAY.
8. The report before last showed HF's were purchasing shares in order to reduce FTD over the course of 3. (Listed Below). Followed by four days in mid JULY!!! (which is also listed below).
9. WHY is this!?!?!? Because CLOVigilantes are not letting up! We keep BUYING to Down Cost Average (DCA), and HODLING for the SQUEEZE...

Here's the TREND:

* 6/28 over 5.6 million shares reported as FTD.
* 6/29 over 2.2 million shares reported as FTD.
* 6/30 over 1.78 million shares reported as FTD. (Last day reported prior to the most current report made public on 8/2). Remember they want to make it look like the SQUEEZE is a dying trend!

The most current report issued, shows the same trend! but instead of 3 days in a row, they were forced to lower the FTD 5 days in a row prior to the bi-weekly cycle! THIS IS PROOF they are in some serious shit!

* 7/08 over 19 million shares reported as FTD.
* 7/09 over 12.7 million shares reported as FTD.
* 7/12 over 11.7 million shares reported as FTD.
* 7/13 (missing) for whatever reason?!?!?
* 7/14 (Last day the bi-weekly report ends) ONLY 141,301 shares that qualify as FTD???

Lets break this down for a moment! The reports come out bi-weekly! They continue to reduce the FTD on the last week prior to the report being made public. My last DD shows this pattern has occurred not Just in July, but also late May, as well as all of June! Thats 4 reports consecutively! Is your jaw dropping yet!?

What can we assume will happen in MID-August!?

* The report made public will happen around the 17th of August.
* It will give us an update on what took place when it comes to FTD to close out July!

What can we assume will happen in early September?

* The reports made public that will show us the first half of August, will come out on the 2nd.
* This will give us data to analyze the FTD that is occuring as of the beginning of this current month all the way until Aug 14th.

Based upon the discussed theory discovered by THE GHOST in regards to the cycle of Rinse and Repeat, HF's are strategically reducing FTD to make it appear that our SQUEEZE is a dying trend as reports are made public. But as we have seen in the past, every report shows what?!?!?! MORE FTD at one point during the most current 2 week cycle, than what was reported in the previous two week cycle!

I'LL REPEAT IT ONCE MORE!

* Current report (released 8/2) shows a high of over 19 million FTD!
* Report prior (released 7/17) showed us a high of over 5 million FTD! (THIS IS ALMOST QUADRUPLE)!

If HF's were actually covering their short positions, we would see the following!

* HF's wouldn't continue to ladder attack us Thursday and Friday, in turn having a ton of calls expiring worthless! (Remember they make money when RETARDED APES YOLO CALLS that expire worthless. No GAMMA SQUEEZE will occur without *in the money* calls on FRIDAYS!
* We would not see reports with the number of FAILS-TO-DELIVER higher and higher throughout the 2 week cycles!

The pattern shows that come next monday 8/9 through 8/11 they will do the same! HF's will simply purchase shares, in order to return the shares to MM'S, in order to reduce the Fails-To-Deliver, in order to make it appear they are backing off yet again! How many fucking times will we see this happen, before we all understand, this is a tactic HF's are using!?!?!

Well guess what!!! This time it's a bit different isn't it!?!?!? One word!!! **EARNINGS**!!!

Now try to keep up right here.

Instead of CLOV releasing earnings in the beginning of a 2 week cycle, 8/16th, which happens to be on a MONDAY at that. This EPIC management team has decided to have their earnings call on a wednesday, prior to the end of a 2 week cycle!

I completely understand CLOV didn't "technically" move up their earnings call!!! The first time they made an official release was on July 15th. But the reason why 8/16 was the projected earnings date, was based upon the timing! Companies usually give earnings calls exactly 3 months apart! The fact that their last earnings call was on a monday the 17th of May, this made sense that the closest Monday 3 months later would be on 8/16! This is why the estimated earnings call was dated on 8/16 according to yahoo finance, nasdaq, etc...

You think members on CLOV's team don't remember what happen last earnings call!? You think they don't see the same trend we see every thursday and friday!?!?!? Of course they do! Everything you do, when you have a publicly traded company, is calculated by all means! They have something up their sleeve this earnings call, and they are daring HF's to try and ladder attack this shit Thursday, the day after earnings and Friday to end the week!

So many people want more from management when it comes to CLOV!

* First we got a detailed line by line explanation from **CLOV** in response to Hindenburg!
* Next we got news about expanding to over 101 counties!
* They brought on new members to their team from UBER, UNH, and GOOGLE!
* Then we got news about the warrants!
* They followed up with the FL expansion regarding primary care physicians and their partnership with **VALUEH.**
* They are purposely releasing news aka catalysts to make it increasingly hard for HF's to continue their malicious attacks!
* The only things that have changed since their first squeeze to 28, is positive changes when it comes to their team, their expansions, and when it comes to dilution of their shares, they did the exact opposite!

Now we should get our normal push on Monday and Tuesday the 9th and 10th of August. This could even run to Wednesday to be honest. This will become an even bigger problem for HF'S! During the earnings call CLOV may drop the name of their NEW CFO. Or maybe they touch up on their vision of at home care. Or maybe they have news to report about their DCE, I mean it does say COMING SOON on their website! I mean maybe CLOV improved their margins per client due to the slow down of COVID during the second quarter. All I know is one thing! If I was a HF, I cant "plan" to short attack on thursday and friday after earnings! It might work out that HF's can, but you cant "plan" on doing so!

Therefore it might be time for HF's to reverse course and start going LONG!

REGARDLESS OF EVERYTHING ABOVE!

PLEASE DO ME A FAVOR, AND SHUT THE FUCK UP WITH "WHY DON'T THEY DO SOMETHING, COME ON CHAMATH SEND A TWEET OR SOMETHING, OUR MANAGEMENT HAS DONE NOTHING!!!"

To insinuate that CLOV has done nothing to combat what is taking place right in front of us, is the epitome of FUD, and shear ignorance.

Most of us in CLOV have legit been invested since MAY or JUNE when the price was over 20! Since when do you purchase shares at an all time high, and expect to see an increase in unrealized gain within 3 months!?!?!?

If you can't sit back and enjoy the ride, I got news for you. Stocks are impossible to time, let alone LIFE! So BUCK the FUCK up and know what you hold! Do some DD and find your conviction!

I'M JUST SAYING! This sub needs to stay positive, and if you find it hard to stay positive during the shit show thats infront of us, then don't post or comment, and take a day off from the SUB! What we need is positive energy! And although I expressed some energy above that can and will be considered negative, please don't misconstrue my PASSION as negativity! I am extremely PASSIONATE when it comes to CLOV! You should be too!!!

The way I see it is simple. Come MARCH of 2022, they will release their 4th quarter earnings of this year! This is after open enrollment occurs, where we will see an increase in patients. Then we have our expansion with physicians in FL with VALUE H! Not to mention, the amount of counties CLOV's services will be offered in, will be double the amount it was this year. By March of 2022, the 4th quarter results in itself should give you the comfort knowing you invested in a growth company, that is doing just that! GROWING!!!! Remember, maybe the squeeze got you here, and although it hasn't happened *yet*, CLOV is in a phenomenal spot!

As always, do your own DD and remember everything written above was based upon theories! This post is not to be taken as FINANCIAL ADVICE. I have no financial background, Nothing I said was to instruct nor convince you to purchase, hold, or sell anything related to stocks or calls when it comes to CLOV!

Can someone tell me why the fuck fintel chose not to report JULY 13th at a time the most Falis-To-Deliver were reduced in one day!?!?!?!?
