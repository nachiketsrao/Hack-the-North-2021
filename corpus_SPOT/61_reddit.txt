TLDR: this will be well over $200 by EOY (33% upside)

ER is Thursday after the close

Spot: $149.88 / 52w High $219

Thesis:

WFA (Work from Anywhere) became a huge trend this spring and summer as people got vaccinated (Jan-Apr) and weren't required to go into the office. I believe TONS of people took advantage of this with pent up demand for domestic travel (international restrictions still apply in many areas).

Enter AirBNB, the clear-cut leader in the rent-someone-else's-home space (nice try, VRBO). They are commanding a huge market share with the most valuable demographics, and many businesses are now allowing business travel to expense AirBNB's -- recognizing that hotels are just one option.

RE investors are a tailwind: with home prices at ATH, there's a throng of younger RE investors that have been buying/rehabbing/renting properties in high-demand cities. There's a whole ecosystem building around property management, cleaning, and listing for AirBNB owners. Low rates = lots of new supply.

I think this is the ER that the business opens people's eyes after their version of the COVID-19 full house (kind of like PTON last year).

Join me and prosper. Rarely do you get a massive TAM, \~30% discount off ATH, and major macro tailwinds.
