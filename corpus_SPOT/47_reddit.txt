 **Business Overview**

Cleveland Cliffs (CLF) is the largest flat-rolled steel producer in the United States. Their recent acquisitions of assets from ArcelorMittal and AK Steel have allowed them to vertically integrate each step of the process in steel production. From mining raw materials (pellets, metallics, coal/coke) to the steel-making process (stamping, tooling, and tubing) everything is now done in-house.

CLF’s product mix encompasses all things steel, mainly: hot-rolled, stainless & electrical, cold-rolled, coated, plate, and others. They have an industry-leading market share with automotive vehicles, which consist of predominantly trucks/suvs (82% versus 18% sedans). Their total end-market mix consists of:

&#x200B;

* 33% is allocated to auto
* 32% is used in distributors & converters
* 24% is with infrastructure & manufacturing
* 11% in the “other” category.

&#x200B;

**The Market Opportunity**

I’ve read quite a few articles comparing CLF and the steel industry to the average cyclical commodity market, but is that really the case? It’s a fools game to think that steel will have a similar correction as to what lumber prices and many other commodities have recently gone through. I will be the first to admit that the current prices of steel may not be sustainable, but the “steelmageddon” many analysts are expecting may never come. One year ago (August 2020) U.S HRC (Hot-Rolled Coil steel) pricing was at nearly $400. CLF CEO Lourenco Goncalves acknowledged the steel industry may never see those prices again.

The smaller steel-mills that have traditionally undercut prices in an attempt to gain market share have all been buried during covid or bought up by larger companies. Steel is no longer looked at as being a true commodity and demand is very robust. The auto-industry that has recently showed a slow in demand due to microchip shortages will have nowhere to go when demand picks up again, thus steel-suppliers have the upper hand.

The U.S market for steel is roughly $103 billion, but with the upcoming infrastructure bill Cleveland Cliffs is about to reap the benefits of continued tailwinds that by the looks of it will continue until at least the end of 2022. How is this cycle different than the others over the last 20-30 years? A lot has changed for CLF as a company in the last year alone, time will tell what they can do in the next 3-4.

Let’s break-down the market opportunity for the company’s top 3 segments of customers.

&#x200B;

1. Auto (33%): Revenues from the auto-industry are down because car manufacturers have not been producing the same output in 2020 and 2021. Chip shortages have hurt the business, however, pent up demand for new vehicles should be a big driver of revenues as we go into 2022. Keep in mind CLF actually went from over 70% exposure to the car industry to now only 33% with these acquisitions making them less dependent on auto-sales.
2. Distributors & Converters (32%): This market usually represents other steel service centers that purchase steel and fabricate/distribute to their customers’ needs.
3. Infrastructure & Manufacturing (24%): The Biden infrastructure plan should increase steel demand within the United States and the broader initiatives will bolster steel prices.

&#x200B;

**Steel Futures, Contracts, and SPOT Prices**

Steel prices have rocketed in the last 12 months. Here’s a chart of the HRC (hot-rolled coil) steel futures pricing. Note it was $400 last summer in July 2020.

&#x200B;

There are a few things to keep in mind when analyzing a steel company’s contracts to the price of raw materials.

&#x200B;

1. Contracts range from 1-year, quarterly, and spot prices (on demand).
2. The auto-industry usually locks in 1-year contracts for price of steel.

I can’t remember precisely, but Lourenco Goncalves, CLF CEO, noted in the most recent earnings call that the average price they’ve locked in for their contracts is around $1,000, which is lower when comparing to the current spot price of $1,900. However, a lot of the on-demand supply being used for infrastructure contracts is being sold at higher spot prices.

Another thing to look at is demand for the auto-industry in 2021, which was very soft. If they locked companies into contracts at a much lower value in 2021, these contracts will be up for renegotiation soon and they will be able to get a much better price. Bottom line, if steel prices maintain at current levels, which is a possibility as demand has been very robust, CLF will be printing cash on SPOT (on-demand) revenue and lock-in further gains on long-term contract renegotiation.

&#x200B;

**Steel Demand - Catalysts**

Here’s a quick breakdown of what is causing surge in steel prices.

&#x200B;

1. China, who previously exported **15% of the world’s steel supply** has **taken an initiative**, by increasing export taxes, to curb pollution, cap production, and keep more supply within China.
2. The Trump administration created policies that increased taxes on exported steel. Now, the Biden administration will likely keep these policies in place as the “hot” steel industry is primed for creating domestic jobs.
3. Throughout covid steel-production was shrinking alongside demand. With everything re-opening and infrastructure projects in place demand is soaring. There is not enough supply to meet demand and steel futures prices are demonstrating this.
4. Auto-industry rebound. Car-makers have taken a hit with chip shortages and have not been able to produce as many cars as they normally would. We’ve all heard about the boom in the user-car markets due to this shortage. The demand is there and production will rebound in the coming years which should maintain strong production from steel-producers.
5. Steel-mills require large amounts of CapEx which is a huge barrier to entry. It would take years for new competitors to begin producing.

&#x200B;

**Risks**

The biggest risk for steel-producers like CLF is a reversal in steel prices that have more than 300x in 12 months. CLF CEO Lourenco Goncalves was asked on their last earnings call about the cyclical-ness of the industry, and his response was:

>“The other thing is that you need to understand that a lot of what's called commodity in our market is actually highly specified material that cannot be interchangeable. It cannot be just replaced at will, even though that's the perception that is sold to the market… Our timing could not be better. Prime scrap is scarce. And every day the price of scrap goes up, our cost savings from HBI becomes more significant.”

I think this gives a lot of insight into how he views the future pricing of steel as a commodity.

&#x200B;

**CLF - Massive EBITDA Growth**

I want to add a separate section for EBITDA growth the company has undergone, because it is outstanding. Here’s a visual from the CLF investor presentation.

https://preview.redd.it/lp6379xgp4g71.png?width=1766&format=png&auto=webp&s=48f8c523f5174ead15c92bd22eb02ceb2d4910ac

&#x200B;

From doing $253 million in 2020 to their recently adjusted guidance of $5.5 billion for 2021 the growth is nearly 2,000%.

I think most analysts are expecting a reversion to the mean for steal prices, but every month steel stays at these elevated prices CLF makes an absolute killing in cash flow. If demand stays as robust as it’s been it looks like CLF might be able to rake in $6 billion EBITDA in 2022, in addition to their 5.5 billion guidance in 2021. Keep in mind these expectations are even surprising management. The company raised guidance in Q1 2021 and again recently on the Q2 2021 earnings report.

After a record quarter, the CEO also commented about how the next quarter will again break records.

>“This being said, our Q2 record numbers: revenue of 5 billion; net income of 795 million; and adjusted EBITDA of 1.4 billion, should not be our all-time records for long… With the lagged and fixed pricing mechanisms we have in place with our customers, we have enough visibility to be confident that these records should be broken again here in the third quarter.”

LG was asked why he thinks CLF’s stock price is still under-valued. As with most companies that deal with commodities (due to how cyclical they are) analysts are short-sighted and can only see what the company is bringing in this quarter… The quote “A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush” comes to mind. However, based on what LG is saying, it sounds like the company will have cash flow like they’ve never seen coming in. He says: 

>“But when I realized that the market is skeptical about a lot of things, that I know that the market is wrong, and I know about the cash flow that's coming, the $1.4 billion in cash coming in Q3 is real, the way our pricing structure is construed as well as the Q4 another, 1.8 billion.”

Lourenco’s main objective is to completely clear the balance sheet of all long-term debt. He’s stated multiple times that by 2022 they can expect to be debt-free. Every dollar they pay down on debt goes to equity and expands CLF’s enterprise value. By this time next year it is quite possible CLF is completely debt-free and printing cash. Excess cash can be used for strategic investments and potentially a share-buyback or dividend, which LG has hinted at before. I see two outcomes, the first is if CLF’s share price is so cheap they may authorize a buy-back of a good chunk FCF.

Let’s say the share price is at $25 this time next year and they authorize $2 billion (two quarters of FCF) in a share re-purchase program. 2 billion dollars equates to roughly 80 million shares. With a float of 450 million shares that’s nearly 18% of the float (!).

On the other hand if the shares appreciate by a large amount the dividend will be quite nice. Lourenco has said many times he thinks the current share price is extremely under-valued. My opinion is that he will do what he can to pump the stock.

&#x200B;

**Valuation & Fundamentals**

I’m going to compare CLF to 3 of it’s competitors. X, Nucor (NUE), and Steel Dynamics (STLD).

https://preview.redd.it/p7vjjt7ip4g71.png?width=1276&format=png&auto=webp&s=859b613f8ffe8fcafa309a8f47dcb90d6039bc23

&#x200B;

At first glance their financials look very similar and you might even say that currently they are all somewhat fairly valued. However, this is based off CLF’s trailing twelve month (TTM) revenues of $12.9 billion while we are expecting that to more than double in 2022. In Q2 2021, CLF management made a clear point in emphasizing that their top-line revenue grew by over a billion that quarter, while their cost of goods sold grew by only $100 million. A huge increase in gross margin which was made capable by their strategic acquisitions and vertical integrations. Don't forget their goal by this time next year is to have zero debt.

&#x200B;

**Final Thoughts**

In my opinion, the extreme growth CLF has seen in revenues and EBITDA and the transformation of the company as whole justifies the stock price at current date. However, when I look into the future and 1-2 years down the road, I very much agree with the CEO in the fact that there is much upside to be seen, with little downside.

I like the fact that the CEO is eager to get the stock price up. I like that the company is looking to completely rid debt from the balance sheet. I like that in 2022 they will have excess cash for more acquisitions or potentially a dividend/buyback. All good signs of a healthy company that has benefited from somewhat of an unexpected boom in steel prices.
