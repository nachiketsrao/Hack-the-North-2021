Platinum is at a significant discount when played with $PPLT in relation to spot Pt  ($1195 /Oz)  and PPPLTâ€™s NAV. 

Platinum is of course at a historic very cheap price in relation to gold and other precious metals and in relation to it own ATH ($2 270). I believe PPLT offers an even more significant discounted price point to enter in to a Platinum position.

Are there hidden dangers to a position in Pt? Other than a sudden $ strengthening all likely hidden dangers (Covid out of control in South Africa etc) along with positive tail winds of inflation, increased automotive demand etc all appear to point to positive price pressure. Anyone who has studied this care to educate me further?
