**Repost to fit subreddit criteria - sorry to keep in SPROTT, but their move affects the main players so it's hard to explain anything without including them. The others were mentioned alongside CCJ, but now it's only CCJ left.**

I'm sure it's not the first time you've come along Uranium, it appeared months ago and went with its success back to where it came from.

Everyone involved in GME, AMC and anything else on here knows there are 3 things you need:

1. A goal to act upon
2. A support from media
3. Big players outside of the general playingfield

GME and AMC have received all 3 heavily. Due to the shorting beyond any reasonable means they were prime targets. This alone was enough for a decent price movement, but media enabled a global coverage of the topic which made so many more people aware of whats going on and flocking in. And lastly, many big names joined in, let it be for testing the waters or to join the fight. I'm sure you have a full list in your mind right now.

**So what's with Uranium?**

Uranium is in a similar position and currently has the most aggressive movements in a company called **CCJ**. CCJ made it on the top 20 list of most bought options (in recent times) multiple times together with names of Tesla, Amazon etc.

I'll explain the reason refered to as point 1, but I'll keep it short as it's the least impact of all. Without 2) and 3) not a lot would happen.

So in short, Uranium mines pretty much tuned down mining over the years due to demand but also because they are in a bad position. Most uranium buyers will only purchase short to mid term what they need instead of making contracts. Since these buyers exist in smaller amounts but with huge impact they can control what happens with the price, pretty much. So production went along with this and decreased to a minimum that can barely cover the needs and even slight interruptions that go on for a while would cause major issues.

Now fast forward to the current date.

This is already 3) named Sprott.

If you don't know Sprott: "Sprott is a global investment manager specializing in precious metals and real assets investing."

What did they do? Well, don't take my word for it, let Bloomberg tell you what's going on:

>Sprott has amassed **over 24 million pounds** of uranium, sometimes buying more than 500,000 pounds in a single day, according to its website and social media account. For comparison, total spot volume for 2020 was 92.2 million pounds, according to uranium investor Yellow Cake Plc.

The expectation here is not a short squeeze as of now. The main expectation is an insane surge in price due to the tight demand-supply that was floating around Uranium and is now majorly interrupted. With how tight it is Sprott can pretty much control the price to an extend and that's why it's going crazy.

**So what's with media support?**

[**https://www.kitco.com/news/2021-09-07/Sprott-s-investment-in-uranium-is-paying-off-and-it-s-just-the-start.html**](https://www.kitco.com/news/2021-09-07/Sprott-s-investment-in-uranium-is-paying-off-and-it-s-just-the-start.html)

Well, you are free to look for yourself, but it started and is as expected. The move of them is hyped up like crazy and this has by far not over at all. The initial price surge came from the news of them buying and announcing it, for a reference:

[SPROTT announces their purchase program of Uranium](https://preview.redd.it/hwy29fg1ram71.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=85af49792f5012cb2166d0e63e736e452c0d2bff)

The media coverage is there and it's just starting off. If you search for Uranium and go 1 month, 1 wekk and 1 day back on the Google search you'll see an exponential increase in articles despite the way less time a single day has compared to an entire week.

**But what's the future of Uranium?**

I can't tell you what happens, if that was the case I'd be rich, sitting on a bought island and slurping cocktails 24/7. But this move caused by a company, not by a random action or idea - so it's their own interest to make the most out of it and considering what they just caused they are most certainly no idiots. The first impact is the announcement and what people understand will follow: A lack of supply. So why shouldn't mines just produce more? They sold a ton to SPROTT and could now satisfy the lack of product, right? Well, not really. If they do this, SPROTT will most likely decline or stop buying more, meaning their bumped up production is completely wasted for a one time pay off that might not even be good for them. But wait, it gets worse - for the Uranium buyers. A ton of nuclear power stations are opening. Nuclear Power is pretty much green energy with a bad side effect of radioactivity, but that's why it was pushed more and more. It's by far better for the environment than coal, which countries move away from - at least if they care about the environment.

So combined: Miners will most likely not increase production because they would shoot into their own foot (their ultimate goal is longterm well paying contracts), demand for Uranium will surge up in the next months and years and SPROTT doesn't stop buying current production. No matter what happens the price will keep surging since SPROTT can pretty much set the price they want, but in a likely case this might spiral to levels that we had back in 2011 with 70-80$ or heck even 140$ in 2007. Mind you a big move away from Nuclear Power Plants happened a while ago and with the new found hype for Uranium and the given issues this could become bigger than ever before.

**So what do I do if I want to join?**

As mentioned you can either buy CCJ. All 3 are well performing among this surge. Don't get me wrong, all Uranium stocks have surged like crazy recently, but most options trading happens in CCJ while.

No financial advise of course, just sharing what my dummy brain was able to gather.
