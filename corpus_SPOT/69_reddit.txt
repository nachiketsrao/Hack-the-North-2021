This company is revolutionary, not just on products but it’s service.

Have any of you even seen NIO day and the enormous mass following on this company? Its walking in the footsteps of Apple. There are some people VOLUNTEERING to be a part of this. 

From its beginnings NIO has established epic foundations. Winning formula E and developing a super car (EP9) holding a lap record around the Nurburgring, more than once, might I add. Take a look at NIO House in Beijing - it is the epitome of what NIO represents. It’s a lifestyle beyond the car. 

NIO cars will soon have a 1000km solid state battery and incase that isn’t enough then feel free to visit one of the 300+ battery swap stations (increasing every day), 300000 fast charging stations over multiple cities in China or simply use power home 2.0. A swap station will have a fully charged battery in your car in 3minutes. They have now competed well over TWO MILLION SWAPS! This tech, while slower to scale than super chargers, is exactly what the EV market is lacking. This is one the greatest stigmas for EV, having to WAIT on your battery charging and worry about degradation. Imagine the continued scope for new service plans and flowing revenues with this model. EYE WATERING. You can walk into a NIO Space and save yourself 11k straight off the bat. We live in a subscription generation folks. Oh, and don’t forget a healthy tapped 2nd hand car market. Encore - Sinopec. 

As for the new ET7 sedan - Nio Partnered with NVIDIA to put their DRIVE Orin-powered supercomputer dubbed ADAM into their car. This supercomputer, will feature four high performance Orin SoCs in each of its EVs to achieve an industry leading performance of 1,000+ TOPS!!  Let  me translate: that’s equivalent to 7, yes you read that correctly - SEVEN -Tesla FSD computers. 

A total of 11 8MP cameras, a 1,550nm LiDAR sensor, five mmWaveRad, 12 USS and two GPS / IMU as well as one V2X and one A.D.M.S sensor are installed in the NIO ET7.

Aquila, is the name for the first high resolution camera (8 MP) that is installed in the vehicle. In comparison, Tesla uses a 1.2 MP camera. The higher resolution and display enables the NIO ET7 to recognize objects and obstacles at a greater distance and to let the system react accordingly. NIO underpins this with numbers, so the system is able to recognize vehicles at a distance of 687 meters; Tesla at 229 meters. Traffic cones would be seen at a distance of 262 meters (Tesla 87 meters) and people at a distance of 223 meters (Tesla 74 meters).

As I said before, you also buy into a service as much as a car with NIO. LIFETIME FREE ROAD SIDE ASSISTANCE. LIFE TIME FREE CAR CONNECTIVITY. UNLIMITED ON THE SPOT TYRE REPAIR AND BACKUP CHARGING CALL OUTS. LIFETIME WARRANTY WITH NO MILEAGE LIMITS. Oh, did I mention NIO house? What’s Tesla doing? **tumbleweed**

As for the market - do any of you truly understand how underpinning the success of a company is with the power of the Asian market? It’s ENORMOUS. It’s economy is now bigger than America, 30-40% of Tesla cars are sold here and with good reason. The demand is unprecedented. The supply simply can’t meet it. There’s room for both but Nio will dominate China and make waves in Europe and America. Heck, it would be immensely great with the Asian market alone. They now have over 1.5million active users on the NIO app, which was recently ranked No. 1 with the highest score of 4.5 stars on a list among 20 other mainstream automakers. This is a beautiful community. NIOs relations executive - Chavin Shens thoughts: “Buying a car is a less frequent activity than taking a flight or shopping at a supermarket. So we need to create more everyday activities to keep customers in touch.”

Loyalty and rewards, my friends. 

Tesla is severely lacking in build quality. Off-set panelling, windows not fitted properly, seats that wear down faster than toilet paper and some dodgy paint jobs along the way. JAC motors builds NIO cars and they are well renowned for quality being associated with VW. NIO has research and development, design, manufacturing and offices in San Jose, Munich, London, Shanghai as well as eight other locations. They are employing and working with some of the greatest talent on this planet. Kris Tomasson - NIO VP of design - This guy was literally a global director at Coca Cola. GLOBAL. AND the Head of exterior design at BMW. What a complete powerhouse (no pun intended). 

BTW - Yes, NIO isn’t Tesla. NIO is taking on its own completely different stance. It’s NIO within its own right. 

Believe or not I do love Tesla, I’m a massive fan! Elon is a visionary and I’d love to be riding shotgun to Mars one day! But don’t let that blind sight you from the uprising of perhaps one the biggest companies in the world. Infact...it already is. 

To summarise folks, what we are witnessing here is the best EV and lifestyle company in the making, bar none, that offers cutting edge technologies and innovations along with customer experience and satisfaction at its core business objectives. The impact of double shifts at JAC will start coming into fruition and before you know it NEO park will have eye watering production. Imagine 500k to 1million NIO cars/year. The Chinese government has backed NIO in more ways than one - subsidising AND bailing them out in times of birthing need. The writing is literally on the wall for ICE cars. NIO will keep delivering, keep breaking records and keep bringing world class innovation.
