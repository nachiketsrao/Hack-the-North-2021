The entire steel sector has been on a tear the past 12 months, with companies like US Steel moving from approximately $6 to $25, and I believe there is plenty of room left to run.  Given that steel prices have been at all time highs, the steel producers have relatively low valuations, and other macro factors, the stock value for companies like US Steel could double or triple this year.

**High Steel Prices**

One of the reasons steel producers have flown under the radar and maintained low valuations has been analysts expectations that steel prices wouldn't achieve the levels they have and that they wouldn't stay at these high levels.  *See examples:*  [*https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/steel-price-rally-seen-under-threat-on-global-supply-revival*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/steel-price-rally-seen-under-threat-on-global-supply-revival)  *and*    [https://www.barrons.com/articles/u-s-steel-stock-got-a-rare-double-upgrade-why-it-will-end-in-pain-51610139992](https://www.barrons.com/articles/u-s-steel-stock-got-a-rare-double-upgrade-why-it-will-end-in-pain-51610139992).  

However, prices have risen over the $1,000/ton peak that some analyst called for at the beginning of the year and touched above $1,600/ton his month.  The price has pulled back a little to closing out at $1,505 on Friday.  However, looking at forward contracts for steel, the price is not expected to fall below $1,000/ton until August 2022.  

To better understand how high the price of steel currently is, see the 10 year chart below:

In 2018, X share price almost reached $50/share.  Given where steel prices are now, I would expect it to touch that again.

**Low P/E**

The rise in steel prices have caused analysis to raise their earnings forecasts for the steel producers, but the stock prices do not appear to fully appreciate these earnings projections.  For example, X is expected to earn approximately $7.95/share in 2021.  At a current price of $25.5, X could earn 1/3 of its current share price in 1 year.      

**China Is Curbing Production**

The largest steel producing country in the world is China.  China's steel production growth over the last 15 years has been one of the main reasons for the demise of the US steel production industry.  This is why I don't compare what X's steel price was in 2008 when steel prices were 1/2 of what they are today.  Its just not the same company with China being the biggest player.

However, China has started trying to curb its production with its new green initiative.  [https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3132666/china-targets-air-pollution-steel-overcapacity-new-curbs](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3132666/china-targets-air-pollution-steel-overcapacity-new-curbs)  Time will tell whether China keeps to its climate change goals and cuts its steel production, but if it does, then we can expect steel prices to remain elevated for a longer period of time.

**Spending Seems To Be Under Control**

One of the disappointments in the steel industry has been poor management.  People who have been investing in X in the past remember Mario Longhi and the destruction he did to this company.  Longhi cut spending when he shouldn't have, he rejected new technology upgrades to produce steel, and he was in charge while the company's intellectual property was stolen by Chinese companies who now produce steel at a much lower cost.  Overall, Mr. Longhi's destruction caused the company to lose its top spot as a steel producer.  

X has a new CEO, David Burritt.  Mr. Burritt seems to be doing a good job turning around the company.  Instead of wasting money on money pits within the company, Mr. Burritt went out and acquired a new  technologically advanced steel mill in Big River Steel.  The timing of the Big River acquisition has played out to be a very well time investment as steel prices were close to their low at the time of acquisition and have tripled since then.  

Overall, the Big River acquisition shows that Mr. Burritt is willing to move away from outdated blast furnaces and into lower cost methods of making steel, which will help US Steel's future earnings.

**Tariffs and Potential Infrastructure Play**

As a tailwind for the steel industry, President Biden has proposed a major infrastructure plan, which includes major spending on roads, bridges, pipelines, etc.  It is expected that this will bill will pass, even it cannot get Republican support.  The infrastructure plan will cause billions in spending on steel products, which could keep steel prices higher for longer than currently anticipated.

In 2018, President Trump placed 25% tariffs on steel imported from China.  Contrary to what some believe, Biden has made it clear that he is not interested in removing the steel tariffs placed on China.  This should also help keep steel prices higher for longer.

**Conclusion**

Overall, for the reasons stated above, I believe X has the potential to climb 2x-3x within this year, if not more.  There are other companies in this space that I will write my opinion on and explain why all are good investments.  For example, Nucor ($NUE), which I also own, is best in class when it comes to steel producers.  I believe NUE represents a great investment, but it has already doubled in the past 3 months.  I think X has the most room to run and is worth your consideration.
