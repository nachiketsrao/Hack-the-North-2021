Spotting a bot:

1. Are they suggesting a company that you are not interested in hearing about? Bot

2. Does their advice sound logical and like would it make you money? Definitely a bot

3. Down vote them and if it sticks, they are a bot

4. Look at their account age. After seeing how old their account is, pick a number higher than that. If the age of their account is lower than the number that you just picked; they are a bot! This one can also be applied to karma.

Other signs: lack of crayons, lack of imagery and videos with green arrows edited into them, lack of OG stocks like GME and AMC. Any use of Robinhood is 100% a bot.

If you find a bot immediately report them to mods, if you are lucky and they're suggesting something that mods haven't invested in, their account will be banned very soon.

Congrats, you are now a bot hunter!
