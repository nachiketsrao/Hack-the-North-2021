 "*Uranium is now considered the top mineable commodity at Morgan Stanley. That news comes just as the new US infrastructure package promises billions of dollars in aid and development funding to existing nuclear plants, as well as advanced nuclear energy technologies. Small module reactor (SMR) projects are already underway in the US and China, while companies like Terrapower plan to supplant retiring coal power infrastructure with nuclear reactors."*


 The prospects for the global nuclear power industry have improved over the last two years because of "ambitious decarbonization goals" that are likely to require significant use of low-carbon nuclear energy, driving an increase in demand for uranium that could be unmet if new mines are not developed soon, the World Nuclear Association said Sept. 8.

"Uranium is a small market at roughly $6.3 billion in annual consumption (180 million pounds at $35/lb). The spark for this price rise was because SPUT (Trust invests and holds substantially all of its assets in uranium), started buying up & storing physical uranium a few weeks back. 

But why is this important? One of the cleanest & most powerful sources of energy, nuclear power could play a key role in the decarbonization goals of countries. Nuclear reactors use fission (splitting of uranium atoms) to produce energy, making it one of the cleanest and economically efficient energy sources."

" recent price action in the spot uranium market underscores our long-standing thesis that uranium prices had hit a bottom in 2016 and were poised for a substantial, long-term bull market due to a multi-year supply deficit which had formed and is only growing with the renewed interest in nuclear power.

" Iran’s new government continued to dramatically increase production of highly-enriched uranium while failing to resume full cooperation with international monitors, signaling a new round of escalation awaits officials when they convene this month to discuss the country’s atomic program. International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors reported yesterday that the Islamic Republic increased its stockpile of uranium enriched close to the levels needed for weapons and was expanding its production capacity.
