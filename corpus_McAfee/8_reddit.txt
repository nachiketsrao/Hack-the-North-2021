Ok, I’m not sure what to think of his dude because he’s had some dog shit years but also some total baller stick your dick on the table public calls (Lehman, the Covid low) and we shall see how that [September tech bubble pop ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-greenlight-letter-idUSKBN27C2UE) call works out.  But for funsies sake, let’s pretend he’s right and the first to fall hard are the second rate (non-fang) recently IPOd unprofitable 30x Price/sales tech stocks.  If we were to play fantasy tech implosion football, what are your fucked company tech bubble apocalypse picks and why? Here’s mine:

- Twilio (trading at 30x sales, fucking 40+billon dollar market cap and even the smart engineers can’t make the shit work)
- Okta (Microsoft AD owns 95 percent of the S&P500 identity management/SSO market and SMB is really competitive and they are taking on a ton of debt because, well, they don’t make money and that’s what you do when you can’t pay your fucking bills)
- Tie: Big Commerce and Shopify.  Two words for Shopify: fucking hundred billion dollar market cap.  Two words for Big Commerce: who?
- McAfee - $4.2B in debt on a private equity dumb money market dump valuing the company at a 7.2B market cap.  

I’ll stop there but fuck now that I think about it there’s some crazy shit out there.  But whatever, share your Einhorn bubble fails.
