-Buys his own version of a private island and leaves the US because he is bored of being filthy rich and money alone doesn't make his dick hard anymore because it's too EZ

-Fucks his harem of hot 16 year olds at age 60

-Runs for president and makes the FBI his bitch in regards to the privacy debate. 

-Comes out of retirement for one final YOLO to make us all rich with MGT. 


Praise be.
