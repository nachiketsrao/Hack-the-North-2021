Mcafee (MCFE)

First and foremost the owner John McAfee didn’t kill himself so let’s establish that now. 

Mcafee is a dominant antivirus software company. You see it everywhere from your Asus to your MacBooks. This software is well ahead of its peers and is utilized even within a plethora of government entities. 

MCFE announced they would be doing a special dividend of $4.50 per share owned with an ex-dividend date of Aug. 12th placing it into tomorrow. The stock hasn’t seen absurd amounts of volatility like we have seen within other special dividend offers through various companies. It is heavily.
