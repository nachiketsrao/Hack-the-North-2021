Not a place for people to pump stocks, just to report what they are actually seeing during the trading day. Thanks for considering it.

Edit: Just to clarify, I'm talking about a daily thread similar to "what are your moves today," except stickied, and then content would mostly focused on price action rather than news items.

For example "ZIOP just jumped 7% in the last 10 minutes, and there is no news out," or "MGT just announced John McAfee is the new CEO, shares are flying"....that sort of content.
