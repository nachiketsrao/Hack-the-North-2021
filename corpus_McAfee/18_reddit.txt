FireEye, seemed like just a few years ago when the company IPO'd the future looked promising, but after topping out at about 85 bucks in 2014, things just went downhill. Price is about flat YoY and continues to remain range bound. There were rumors about 2 years ago that Cisco or IBM would make a play for the company to add to the security sides of their product portfolios respectively, but nothing has materialized. With the founder gone, management shakeup including the removal of David Dewalt who has a history of selling companies for a pretty penny (Documentum to EMC and McAfee to Intel), what are the FEYE's prospects for being the target of an acquisition, especially at a relatively cheap multiple? Will this company go bankrupt? Can't imagine today's news about an employee of the company getting hacked bodes too well for them..
