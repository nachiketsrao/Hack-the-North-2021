I know mcafees financials weren't mentioned in the 10-q that dropped today, just the deal In terms of how much the transaction was worth in shares and the pre McAfee earnings and valuation of the company, but when will we actually know about the relative worth of dvasive and other McAfee acquisition? Their financial report coincided with an increase in share price so I figured something about mcafees earnings were in there but nope
