My post from yesterday ;  
  
>Yes its true. The only thing moving this stock is the market. Today it was the most traded stock on the entire exchange. Once this volume dies down, this stock will fall down fast and very hard.
Fundamentally, nothing has changed for this company since it was a 0.30 cent stock, besides management restructuring. It's still a completely shit company. No pipeline, no revenue, lots of debt, lots of dillution and more dilution to come for sure.
And McAfee? The guy has spent the last 20 years or so living in Belize and doing drugs. He doesn't know shit about the cyber security space anymore. He's 70 years old and way past his prime. There's a bunch of new cats in the space now and they have far more connections and wealth to use. They can crush him like a cockroach.
I have been day trading the heck out of this stock for over a week now but there is no doubt in my mind that it will fall extremely hard soon. Today is a good example of that when it got rejected at $5 and fell off to $3.70.
Don't be caught holding when it tanks. ( Mod removed my post when I made this LOL scared? )
  
  
Hopefully at least some people listened.
