Bloom Energy $BE is on the brink of profitability and is going on a billion in revenues this year.  This is larger than its 6 next competitors including $PLUG, $BLDP, and $FCEL.  Bloom is also growing at a high 25-30% CAGR.
The current quarter results come on August 4th and the August 20th calls cover this period if you are looking at a stock and option strategy.  
BE trades at a 3x to 20x discount even though it’s by far the largest competitor in the fuel cell industry with the most efficient electrolyzers and a proven solution to the problems of today’s energy grid.  Blooms large client portfolio include Amazon, Apple, Google, Walmart, Southern Company, SK Energy, and many more.
News yesterday included a deal with Heliogen to pair Bloom’s electrolyzer technology with solar energy.
Heliogen is going public soon through a Bill Gates backed SPAC.  
You really have to listen to a Bloom Energy conference call to get the most out of all their growth drivers.
