Not too long ago, when I was just a little shit disturber in grade 3, I kicked a rock that was on the pavement of our playground as hard as I could. why not? Kicking rocks is cool as shit. anyways. This rock decided today it was time to fuck somebody's day up real hard. This little girl was crouching down, and I got to watch as the rock bounced and smacked this little girl right in the side of her head. I had fucked up.

I'm telling you this because among other lessons, I learned about "timing", and maybe looking at what's ahead of you before yeeting a jagged rock as hard as you can. that shit was traumatic, maybe a bit more for her than it was for me.

This may have been the same thing fellow low I.Q. apes like me have been feeling since jumping in on CLNE back in June. I had deposited my entire year's worth of Arby's Roast Beef Sandwich money, and I have since watched it reach a new low of $6.62 on August 19th.

So, hey idiot, you ask, why would I look at investing in CLNE after what you just said? well damn let me get straight on to it.

If you're reading this and you don't know about Clean Energy Fuels, you can follow the links below for further details on their fundamentals (from u/Tmoney127):

Here is a link to the DD which explains their deal with Amazon (from u/NrdRage):

What happened?:

It's February 2021. this old guy was just elected president, and he is a big fan of GREEN ENERGY. And so, the "green wave" begins. CLNE just so happens to be poised as the industry leader in putting RNG into trucks across America. On February 9, 2021 the stock reached a $19.79 high. a 670% growth in 3 months.

Why was everyone excited?:

Renewable Natural Gas (cow farts) is not fossil fuel, it captures harmful methane and turns it into usable gas. I won't get too far into detail, but let me just say RNG is a better play than EV or hydrogen, if we want to reduce carbon emissions in the SHORT TERM. RNG can be used for big rig transpo's NOW. not next year, and not 10-20 years down the road. We aren't ready for Hydrogen Fuel cell infrastructure. We don't need MegaChargers. Cow farts are running through our pipelines as we speak, and the room for exponential growth is quite wide.

Now you may have heard all this back in June, when a few popular DD's popped up here. The stock had reached a pull-back to $11, and it would have sounded great. You might have said to yourself, "there's no way to lose here, this is going MOOOON". cow, fart, rocket, moon.

let's take a look at the positions cost distribution for CLNE:

[If you have yet to invest into CLNE, there's hope. This is beyond thrift store sale prices. I want to be one of those guys in the green.](https://preview.redd.it/5t8r1zd1hgj71.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ac39154f19cab59d6cf4b63bcaf3b55d44a2474d)

Listen, I got C's in grade school. but I'm smart enough to learn from my mistakes like putting the peanut butter on the bread BEFORE putting it in the toaster might be a bad idea. If you're buying CLNE near it's new 2021 low, you're doing investing right.

Why invest now?:

CLNE just recently managed to reach a moving average crossover on it's daily chart, after 3 days of 5-8% gains (3 white soldiers, also bullish) the short-term moving average has surpassed the long-term moving average, which signals a bullish breakout pattern.

The UN released it's IPCC report, specifically mentioning the need to cut methane emissions.

Dems are about to pass a $3.5 trillion dollar infrastructure bill that specifically mentions carbon capture (i.e. capturing methane from cow poop), and green energy

On August 17th, CLNE signed new, and renewed, multi year contracts with cities across America, to provide millions of gallons of the precious cow fart fuel for its city vehicle fleets

Q2 earnings beat analyst estimates with a $0.01 EPS and actual revenue of $70.89 million

Bottom Line:

CLNE might be on a Bullish trend reversal. If you decide to wait and see what happens, that's fair, but don't get mad when you're left coughing up soot and NOx in your boomer diesel rig, while CLNE fuels our Cummins driven carbon negative chariots all the way to tendieland.
