It’s Friday baby fuck baby time to bust some shorts baby wooo

In a time where retards like you and I are searching for the next play like it’s some delicious glue, I present to you GoodRx. Looking for a braindead play to take advantage of short volume getting caught out undervaluing a company? Look no further.

GoodRx provides a platform to search for prescriptions, enabling users to track drug prices to compare options. It also provides free drug coupons for discounts on medications, runs a subscription service for further discounts and free deliveries, among other services.

On 8/12, they released 2Q earnings, notably reporting 43% y/y growth and 6mil monthly active users (up 36%). After beating revenue and earnings, GoodRx jumped 18.6% and has been trading at around the $35-37 range. With a 52-wk high over $64 and low of $26, the upside suggests there’s plenty of room to run. Since earnings, the short volume ratio has not dipped below .40, averaging closer to .55 over that time.

You’ll see that short volume has not changed much since a solid earnings report, including news about a partnership with Surescripts, who manage a platform that allows prescribing physicians to see the drug’s cost for their patients. This is just one of a few strategic partnerships GoodRx made over the past year to contribute to the massive revenue gain.

Highshortinterest,com lists the short interest as of 8/13 over 28%. The set-up is among the best for short interest and has the potential to run on low volume.

Future growth opportunities are strong for GoodRx, who reports that its prices beat insurer prices by 50%, while out-of-pocket prescription costs in the US reach all-time highs. More consumers will be looking for prescription discounts, and GoodRx leads the way.

**Bear case:**

In the short run, independent pharmacies have hit back over the Superscripts partnership. They claim that the deal will hurt independent pharmacies and further obscure drug costs, as GoodRx discount information will only pricing data for pharmacy partners of GoodRx, leaving out independent pharmacies. Further, they say negotiated discounts would only appear for the uninsured or patients whose price information isn’t already available from their insurer or benefit manager. In the short run this may have implications, but that depends on the likelihood of Superscripts to back out on the deal.

In the long term, Amazon Pharmacy may present headwinds to GoodRx and any other player in this space. Though mail-order prescriptions only make up \~5% of fill count in the U.S., Amazon’s entry into the pharmacy space is probably more concerning than CEO Trevor Bezdek lets on. He claims for the current period that they’ve seen “zero impact from Amazon Pharmacy or any other companies in that space”.

**Current situation:**

Despite solid earnings and future growth potential, short volume on the stock has been mounting. Sitting near the top of high short interest stocks, GoodRx is being treated as the only way from here is down. The macro situation for GoodRx is rather positive in both the near term and over the long haul as us pill-popping degenerates look for cheaper options for our Adderall prescriptions.

Do you sniff paint? Do you like trend analysis? Ok fine, here’s some bullshit I drew on a chart

Not enough bullshit for you? Analysts' price target is $41.71, with highs of $56. It sits today up 5% on the day on rather low volume, so these shorts may already be feeling some pressure.

**Positions:**

42.50c 10/15, shares

**TL:DR**
