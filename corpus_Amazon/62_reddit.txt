$NAUT went public in June via special purpose acquisition company A R Y A whose director bought 5.5M shares at $10 (insider buying), Amazon owns $15M of shares, and separately Jeff Bezos invested in this company prior to it going public. 

"Nautilus raised a $76 million Series B round raised last year led by Vulcan Capital, the multi-billion-dollar holding company created by the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. Bezos Expeditions, the VC arm of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, also invested, along with Perceptive Advisors, Andreessen Horowitz, Madrona Venture Group, and others."

Today trading was halted at least twice as shares spiked from $7.50 to around $11.50. Avg volume has been 180k and today was 28 Million! This was due to [this CNBC report](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/08/05/amazon-invested-millions-in-nautilus-biotechnology.html) that dropped today, some calling it a pump and dump, as shares quickly dropped under $9 once trading resumed. 


Goldman Sachs initiated [coverage](https://www.streetinsider.com/dr/news.php?id=18765251) yesterday with a neutral rating and $10 target. 


Also, mid-July, "With a Buy rating, Jefferies initiated coverage on Nautilus Biotechnology Inc (NASDAQ:NAUT). The price target seems to have been set at $13.00 for Nautilus Biotechnology."


Earnings are expected on August 10th. 


*So What Is It?*

From the cnbc article: "Nautilus has built a prototype for a device that can measure the human proteome, a set of proteins in the body that, unlike the genome, is constantly changing based on food consumption and other factors.
Companies such as Thermo Fisher Scientific produce mass spectrometers, but those devices can be expensive and and only yield a small percentage of proteins from a drop of blood, Sujal Patel, co-founder and CEO of Nautilus, said in an interview. The company wants to become capable of measuring more than 95% of the proteome.
Organizations could use the system for drug discovery, as well as clinical diagnostics and precision medicine. In 2020 Roche-owned Genentech agreed to use Nautilus' system, and the companies plan to publish their research findings. Nautilus expects its first revenue in 2022 and is targeting a long-term operating margin of 25% to 30%. Patel, formerly co-founder CEO of data-storage hardware company Isilon, which EMC acquired in 2010 for $2.3 billion, said Nautilus will sell its instruments along and provide cloud-based software."


The article continues with some of its uses. 


Personally, I've been tracking this company since last year, and was excited to finally be able to invest in them. I've lost about $1,000 in expired options, there's very little volume on average. I was hoping for a jump once they went public but oh well. I sold all my shares today for a profit at $11.50 (phew, those bags were getting heavy lol), then bought another hundred about an hour later at $8.75. I'll begin accumulating again. 


This is definitely a long term speculative play, but I think this is exactly the kind of "disruptor tech" that growth investors get excited for, and with their first earnings report next week on 8/10, the shares are looking pretty inexpensive at the moment. 


Good luck out there!
