This is not Financial Advice and I am not a Financial Advisor. Do your own DD.

If you previously saw there was a similar DD posted two weeks ago on $AMZN and $AFRM partnering. TLDR: The url [amazon.com/affirm](https://amazon.com/affirm) redirected you to a link that insinuated an agreement.

Now ESPN and Draftkings already have a history together with a deal from 2020. See link for detail on this.

This 3b deal was rumored last Friday. TLDR: "On offer is the right for a suitor to use the ESPN name for branding purposes and potentially rename its sportsbook after the leading sports TV network in the U.S., the people said. A deal could come with an exclusive marketing commitment that would require the sports-betting firm to spend a certain amount of money advertising on ESPNâ€™s platforms, one of the people said." [https://www.wsj.com/articles/espn-explores-sports-betting-deal-worth-at-least-3-billion-11630089962](https://www.wsj.com/articles/espn-explores-sports-betting-deal-worth-at-least-3-billion-11630089962) Yes, this would have massive implications on revenue growth for $DKNG.

Now, as of today, if you search [draftkings.com/espn](https://draftkings.com/espn) it takes you to a legitimate page. Will this be the same clue before the official announcement as $AFRM? I don't know. But I'm willing to gamble on it.

Edit:  If you search espn.com/draftkings it has a redirection to [http://games.espn.go.com/ffl/welcome\_dk](http://games.espn.go.com/ffl/welcome_dk)
