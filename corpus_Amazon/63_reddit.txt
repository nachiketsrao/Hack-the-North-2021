I love this company. They just merged with Holicity which I also think was a super cool company.  I've been following Rocket Labs and Space X and this company has blown me away.

Astra CEO, Chris Kemp, said:

>We're  actually building a space platform - in much the same way that when  Amazon started, they weren't marketing themselves as a delivery truck  company or a warehouse company. We're really trying to solve the problem  that our customers have, which is they want to put stuff in space  quickly.

"In December 2020, Astra joined a small, elite group of companies that  have made it to space. With over 50 launches in manifest across more  than 10 private and public customers, including NASA and DOD, Astra has  booked over $150 million of contracted launch revenue. Astra will begin  delivering customer payloads this summer and begin monthly launches by  the end of this year. "

They are definitely going to be a leader in lightweight, low-cost launch vehicles for microsatellites and nanosatellites. I would say take a look at them do your DD before Cathy Wood adds them to her Space ETF coming out soon.
