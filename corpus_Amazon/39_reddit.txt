If you havenâ€™t taken a look at CHWY you are a brainless ape that might miss a lifetime of riches and opportunity.

CHWY is currently trading at $90, which is below our target of $333 by the end of the year.

You probably think thatâ€™s a bit high, but really itâ€™s not. Let me explain:

CHWY is Amazonâ€™s largest competitor in the pets eCommerce space. Do you know what itâ€™s like to be a competitor against Amazon?

NO you donâ€™t. So let me tell you.

Amazon always engages in overly aggressive competitive behavior by lowering prices at a loss just to take out any competition. Some say thatâ€™s a monopolyâ€¦..ðŸ¤ª

This is obviously bad news for CHWY, but what you donâ€™t know is that Amazon may be a bully, but this is a story of David vs Goliath.

CHWY has been crushing earnings after earnings and the stock price has been increasing, while AMZN loving retards have been trying to short the stock in hopes that Amazon will crush them. The current short interest is 16.25% which is not the highest, but itâ€™s been increasing.

Itâ€™s sad to see the pressure from the bullies over at Amazon trying to sink this stock, but what they donâ€™t know is that we had a reddit family of retarded all-in betting mindless ape warriors. These apes arenâ€™t going to just let the bullies win.

Itâ€™s like they didnâ€™t learn their lesson from GME & AMC.

Weâ€™re not going to let them get away with this one. Weâ€™re going 3 for 3.

Letâ€™s show Jeff Bezos how to build a real rocket that doesnâ€™t blow up. ðŸš€

So whoâ€™s f**ing in? ðŸ‘Š

And if you have paper hands donâ€™t even think about buying this stock. The diamonds will be too heavy for you. ðŸ’ŽðŸ’ŽðŸ’Ž

Not financial advice. I yoloâ€™d my portfolio on this. Riding the spaceship to the moon. ðŸš€ðŸŒ•
