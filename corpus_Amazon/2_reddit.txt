**Best cybersecurity solution: Tie:** **CrowdStrike** **and** **IronNet**

* CrowdStrike won for providing their customers with comprehensive endpoint and workload protection and visibility by using machine learning (ML), behavioral analytics, and proactive threat hunting to stop all attack types, while making sure they can meet the most stringent compliance requirements.
* IronNet won for their Collective Defense platform, the first cybersecurity solution that detects unknown threats and shares actionable intelligence at machine speed among a community of organizations. IronDefense, IronNet’s network detection and response solution, and IronDome, IronNet’s threat intelligence sharing solution, deliver radar-like visibility into the threat landscape, and provide customers with advanced warning of potential incoming attacks.

I don't trust my analysis but I don't doubt the bi\*ches who work for bezos. Some don't even speak English. If they say the product is a tie then I believe it.
