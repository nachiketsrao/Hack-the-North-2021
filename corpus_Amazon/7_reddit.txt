Dear Apes, Autists, Retards and Chads,

&#x200B;

I recently posted a $WISH YOLO: I have secured three personal loans and YOLO'd $80k into Dec '22 $8/$15 Call Debit Spreads (post link: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pioi79/80k\_wish\_leaps\_yolo\_funding\_secured\_from\_3/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pioi79/80k_wish_leaps_yolo_funding_secured_from_3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)).

&#x200B;

Why am I so bullish on a supposedly shit company? Wish seems to have major problems:

* Cheap product quality
* Slow delivery times
* User acquisition issues
* Customer retention issues
* Falling revenue growth

The problems, at first glance, seem very serious. At the end of the day, why invest in a growth company that has stopped growing?

&#x200B;

I was fully aware of all the above problems when I decided to YOLO with bank dolo. In my opinion, Wish has only one problem that will solve ALL of its problems if addressed. If Wish can improve product quality, by weaning itself off cheap Chinese products and choosing merchants that offer popular brands, all other problems will be solved, excluding slow delivery times. A better product range will increase user acquisition and retention which, in turn, will increase revenue growth.

&#x200B;

As for slow delivery times, Wish's Logistics revenue increased 126% in the second quarter and slow delivery times are no longer a common complaint - which confirms delivery times have improved, and continue to improve as Wish expands its Logistics operations. Furthermore, the Wish Local feature offers same day pick-up.

&#x200B;

I would also urge investors to stop comparing Wish to an Amazon or an Alibaba. I compare Wish to eBay, which leads me to believe Wish is grossly undervalued when comparing market caps. Why compare Wish to eBay? Four years ago, I bought a black leather belt from eBay; I recently purchased that same belt from Wish: Wish is more similar to eBay than Amazon or Alibaba. And even if Wish is only HALF an eBay, it means Wish's stock price may 5x according to market caps.

&#x200B;

I also love how management is aware of and responsive to the two main pain points, low product quality and slow delivery times, and have decided to continue addressing these issues going forward. And to help navigate the turnaround, Wish has a strong cash position, which means they should not require additional equity capital (i.e. share dilution).

&#x200B;

It is also worth mentioning that Wish will most likely not moon or short squeeze. I do believe, however, that it will 2x, or even 3x, by end of next year: notice how my short leg is only $15 and not something ridiculous like $50. Improving product quality and delivery times, in my opinion, will be game changers that should reignite investor interest.

&#x200B;

Lastly, why did I invest now and not later? The stock market is forward-looking. The market will not wait for Wish to be profitable before the stock price starts to increase; rather, the market is merely waiting for signs of a return to profitability. Improving product quality will be that sign.

&#x200B;

Anyways, just thought I'd share my rationale for my investment decision.
