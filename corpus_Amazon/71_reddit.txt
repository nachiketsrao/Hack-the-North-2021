Obligatory: This is my first DD, if it even counts as DD and I don't know tf im doing. not advice. Listen to your pet rock before listening to me.

If you want a summary of what Matterport does: I'm not gonna copy pasta; [Here's what they do](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ou2ap9/mttr_bringing_3d_photogrammetry_experiences_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Ever since they were a SPECulation, I've been into MTTR. Wanted to write a DD on this sooner but had to wait for shares to issue out so that they'd get a $1B+ MC. This is kinda DD kinda Discussion, I'm not too sure what it is but I'm writing this to convince my wife's boyfriend to give me allowance to buy more.

# Real Estate Play?

Wait... they just take pictures of houses and shet. idgaf. Housing market gonna crash and we're all gonna kiss Burry's ass again. Trash play.

Well... sort of, let's do an analogy.

If stonks go up, who makes money?

1. Bulls
2. The brokers earning commission from you apes

If stonks go down, who makes money?

1. üåà üêª
2. The brokers earning commission from you apes

Matterport is the tool that brokers use. They have contracts with Redfin, apartments.com, vacasa, etc

Listing sites like Zillow and Airbnb also support user uploaded Matterport imaging.

Buy, sell, rent, hotel, BnB, market up, market down, ERRYTHANG!

In other words, they're gonna make money regardless of real estate market.

# Covid/Recovery Play:

Is it too late to play covid? maybe, but Florida thinks otherwise.

Online shopping/home improvement: Rather than annoying the living shet outta amazon by returning the 9/10 items you just bought, you can virtually place the item in your home and see how it fits or looks.

When you're stuck at home gong crazy staring at the wall, you might plan your next trip. Resorts, hotels, parks, vacation sites. While everyone is stuck at home, these places'll use Matterport to instill as much FOMO as they can to get customers to line up once the pandemic is over.

# Other Streams of Revenue/Applications:

Retail: You ever buy something at Ikea, bring it home, assemble it, and find out it doesn't fit correctly or it doesn't match the fungshui of your living room? Neither have I, but I'm sure someone has. And Matterport can help you see whether your curtains will match that bean bag you always wanted. Aside from this, retailers have instructions from corporate on their store layout and shelving. Matterport will play a big role in facilitating this so that these managers don't have to drive/fly to every city in their jurisdiction.

VR/AR: They have a deal with Face mother f-ing Book. That deal was just for research and AI. You know what else FB owns? Oculus. MTTR can easily enter VR/AR space with their technology to enter the gaming and 'adult' industries.

# Short Interest:

IDGAF about the short interest. They're gonna make bank and that'll lead to me to making bank. I like the stock. and tbh, I'm such an ape, I don't even know how to reliably check short interest. I just like the stock.

# PR:

If you create the world's best invention; you'll still be dirt poor if no one knows about it. The same goes with stocks. Matterport just hired 2 new PR specialists in the past 2 months - a VP of Investor relations Soohwan Kim, and VP International marketing, Vivian Weiying Pan. If you didn't know about Matterport before, you'll know about it now. More people = more investors = stonks going up
