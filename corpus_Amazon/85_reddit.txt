Title should be October 15 puts not 11-15. What's up fellow retards,

I am applying my strategy as a day trader to see what our long term resistance and support levels are. I'm a day trader of three years that has consistently used standard deviations, relative volatility index, and volume on a 6month and 1year time frame to determine my buy/sell areas on stocks, no matter whether I am swing trading or trading intraday.

\-Easy Breakdown of Statistical Standard deviations - 68% of a stock's price range over a given time frame is within 1 statistical standard deviation (2 blue lines) of it's average/regression trend (middle line), 95% within two deviations (first upper and lower purple lines), and 99.7% within 3 deviations (second upper and lower purple lines), known as the 68-95-99.7 rule. Most importantly, these deviations also function as true support and resistance levels, with deviations, once crossed, becoming either the new resistance or new support level. I generally use this to find stocks that are trading above +2 deviations to short/buy puts or at -2 deviations to buy calls/stock as these areas represent only 5% of the price action over a given time period and statistically, there's a 95% chance the price will drop back below or climb back above +2/-2 deviations, respectively. I did this with Amazon puts recently as AMZN was trading above +2deviations. Otherwise I mostly trade off deviation support and ride volume up to next deviation resistance level before exiting the position which is what these TAs will be about.

\-So, let's keep it simple stupid. Moderna, MRNA, is currently trading right along +2 deviation support on 6month chart, and right below +2deviation support on the daily(one year) chart. I've drawn red price level lines at these deviation support/resistance levels that carry over onto the one day chart. You'll need to download the charts to see the deviation levels.

This is the intraday chart with the same red price level deviation support/resistance lines carried over -  [https://imgur.com/B7nOWox](https://imgur.com/B7nOWox)

We are BARELY holding +2 6month deviation support of around $315. At open today, I'll be buying $270 and $300 puts for October 15th.

Now, because deviation support is being held I expect there's a slight chance MRNA needs to complete its move up to +2deviation resistance on one year of $332 area before reversing, in which case, I'M JUST GONNA BUY MORE PUTS -  [https://imgur.com/GG4hhCo](https://imgur.com/GG4hhCo)

\-Why $270 as my lower target? Because it's +1 Deviation on the One year chart. I could play the Mean/Average/Regression line (middle line on one year/6month/intraday) but I like to manage my risk and will be selling the PUTS once the price target of $272 area is reached (remember +1/-1deviation is blue lines on the charts) since this is the first statistical support area where the price may bounce a bit since we have deviation support on both one year and 6 month  -  [https://imgur.com/QyZlioQ](https://imgur.com/QyZlioQ)

Edit - To all those messaging me saying it didn't happen...this isn't a short play. This is for those looking past the FOMO waiting for the sell-off. Buy your PUTS 60+ days out and it'll be below $300 again.
