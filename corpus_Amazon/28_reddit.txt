Alright so tesla has been range bound for like 5 months , really from feb its been on a doward trend then from march till now its been ranged bound from 600-700. As of recently its starting to break out of this range soon, and if yall ever seen what happens to a range bound stock thats been consolidating for months look at amd, apple, amazon , netflix etc. It gets extremely nasty for bears. 

Tesla has been looking bullish recently and has had a lot of good news coming its way , so first off q2 earnings. 

tesla used to make a shit ton of cash from its ev tax credits , it still did but it wasnt as much of its revenue . which is a good thing

next , tesla beat rev expectations coming in with 11.96 billion dollars with a net income of over 1 billion dollars for the first fucking time guys! This is huge because well you see, it pulled this off while facing supply issues and supply chain issues are usually problems that are fixed relatively quick ( depends how fast we get covid more under control)  so imagine what it can do when supply chain issues are fixed . Also just so yall know last year q2 tesla had a net of 100mil soo it 10xed it .

Its has 3 mega factories now , germany , china and the usa and when they are at full capacity they will be able to create an estimated 1 million teslas each which means atleast 3 million teslas per year allowing tesla to keep up with its demands and also possibly lower its prices due to volume . **Now this is important pay attention.**

**Tesla has a self driving subscription for about 100 a month.** Basically people can opt into a monthly sub and have self driving feature . This is amazing because a it makes tesla even more money on top of its car sales but b the data that tesla gets from the fsd will help improve its self driving and make it even better than before.

 Now imagine the factories at full capacity , 3 million cars each year say 90% of them are sold so thats like 2.7 million now from a conservative stand lets say of those 2.7 mil only 6% get the sub for a year that means 162k people have the sub. They pay 100 a month soo basically 1 year tesla raked in about 194 million off of that alone and they would be able to collect more data about driving from 160k more new people . AND this isnt even including the people who previously bought a tesla and have a fsd subscription that they will probably have for the following years aswell.

Now one last thing , tesla doesnt only make cars . They also work on being very efficient with energy storage and use.  Tesla has a solar energy sector that makes millions, tesla has its own insurance , and most importantly tesla is testing out and refining energy storage. Remember that tesla factory battery fire in Kangaroo land? Well that caused the stock to soar because it remined investors that holy fuck tesla isnt only a car manufacturer , its a fucking tech company . 

Either way tesla is about ready to make its climb from 700 back to 900s its just a matter of when.

TLDR- Tesla stock brrrrrrr
