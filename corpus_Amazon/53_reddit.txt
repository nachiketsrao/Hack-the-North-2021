 "it's not about the money, it's about sending a message."

And the message is "we are fucking retarded."

The difference between trading and investing is that traders trade because they think they can beat the overall market. And traders want to do it quick, not over time. 

Sure, the above gains are abnormal, but also so is every trader in this sub. We are trading in abnormal times with abnormal strategies. Think you could beat 100% + (unleveraged) in a year? A very small subset of the 10 million retards in this sub have done that, no doubt winners are here. I myself was up over 400% this year on my way to a half-mil, only to lose more than 60% of it in the past 4m. Clearly on my wins I got lucky, as much as I'd like to thank myself and my "strategy"

Win big a few times, absolutely possible. Remain ahead of the market over a long period of time? The odds are extremely against you.

Finally, a ton of credit to the few who have actually been able to beat the market over a long  period of time. You are out there no doubt, but you are in the gross minority. By means of [survivorship-bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias) you will meet these people along the way because they survived to tell the story. You do not hear of the masses as they lose and drop out of the game. The very very few that survive, like DFV, you will hear of their stories, but do not confuse it with the norm.
