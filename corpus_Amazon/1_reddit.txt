We all know that PLTR is committed to hire only the best software engineers and data scientists. Many CS majors think that getting a job at PLTR is harder than being hired at a FAANG company and recent statistics show that PLTR is the tech firm with the highest-percentage of new recruits coming from Ivy-league universities. However, as PLTR just recently started to create a salesmen workforce, I was curious about what their requirements might be. It turns out that they are absolutely insane. Check them out:

What we value: Proven track record of large-scale enterprise sales to government or commercial institutions. Enterprise sales experience in either the automotive, pharmaceutical or energy industry is highly preferred.
 
Requirements: 

+10 years enterprise sales experience

+10 years experience in generating and developing new business opportunities

+10 years experience in working with technical and non-technical business partners to identify business need

Ability to travel (50%+) per business needs

It comes as no surprise, that the company is very aggressive when it comes to giving stock options. Amazon was unprofitable for years, cuz it was investing heavily with the goal of growing its business and acquiring assets. Well, PLTR's assets and business are its employees. PLTR's product is superior, because its employees are the best. Actually,  the relatively high SBC might be a blessing in disguise for investors, but only time will tell. What do you guys think?
