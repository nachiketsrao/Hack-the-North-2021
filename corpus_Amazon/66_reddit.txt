EXPI is an interesting company as they are one of the biggest cloud based brokerages. They are looking to revolutionize the real estate market by moving away from brick and mortar brokerages and move entirely to the cloud. Their growth over the past year has been impressive and they are aggressively moving into new international markets. They are trying to be the next Amazon of real estate.  This is not financial advise just a company I like.
