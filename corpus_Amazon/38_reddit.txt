Ok my fellow smooth brains trying to compare this to the likes of $WISH, $CLOV, and $AMC. While I do love throwing money away on memes to fund the hedge fund manager's bastard son's third yatch he fucks my girlfriend on, I do also like to find something that'll make me some money in order to afford tissues to wipe my tears. One of those right now at this current price point is $CLNE.

We might think $CLNE is a meme and pump/squeeze play that famed WSB, but it is not. It got some hype because Apes got word of the low public float and saw that it had some short percentage of around 10% of public float and thought they wanted to buy cow farts that signed a deal with Amazon. So they bought the hell out of it just to watch HFs come in and short it to death from $20 to where its at now \~$6.60.

At the current price the market cap of the company is about $1.49B making it a nice value. You might say, "will it go moon?". Then I'll reply, "take the crayon out of your mouth, close your mouth when you breathe, and hold on until the end my good friend."

$CLNE all you need to know is that they sell fuel, a special kind of fuel that is made from waste that lowers emissions. This fuel already has an infrastructure and is a cheaper and more scalable transition than other energy sources and is the only one that is carbon negative, not just carbon neutral. The company already has signed deals to distribute the fuel to companies and local governments. More recently they signed a few deals for 26M gallons which is about 25% of their quarterly numbers put out in Q2 of 2021 which increased by 13% year over year. Not only are they signing deals to provide fuel, they are also being awarded contracts to build RNG stations that are worth millions. The thing about RNG is that the existing infrastructure is limited and needs expanding. This brings me into the infrastructure bill that has allotted $30B in funding to expand renewable fuels infrastructure. $30B is 20x the current market cap, but won't all be directly awarded to $CLNE. While $CLNE is the market leader in this emerging energy space the government won't hand it out just to them to fund the actual infrastructure for it.

Now we get into the value. Current market cap sits at $1.49B, best numbers I have found for total assets hover around $1B-$900M depending on the source. Total liability sits at $100M. So worst case we have a total share holder equity of $800M with TO INCLUDE DEBT! This isn't some black magic accounting scheme where they have piles of debt and turn it into assets on books to get a desirable P/B ratio. $800M equity which includes over $254M in cash and short term investments which is up 70% from last quarter. So we have an unleveraged 1.86 P/B ratio. This might not seem like much, but this is one of the only cash positive, unleveraged, and profitable small cap companies in all of energy not just renewable energy with that low of a P/B. Not to mention they are pioneering the market.

So the company looks good on the books, year over year growth, future growth and a mega catalysts in the infrastructure bill. Something that does need to be addressed was Q2 revenue numbers which is due to $79M in revenue allotted to Amazon Warrants. Without the warrants revenue would be above $79M and cost to operate would be significantly lower.

For my mouth breathing brethren looking for moons and quick gains in a market that is murdering poor souls left and right: This is not just a meme stock, but it can be squeezed with 10% of public float being short, only 150M in public free float, and 2.6 days to cover. However, that is outside of the scope of the DD...

Edit: Looks like WSJ has a perfect link for this.  [CLNE | Clean Energy Fuels Corp. Quarterly Balance Sheet - WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CLNE/financials/quarter/balance-sheet) u/Caveat_Venditor_   was nice enough to point it out, but in his comment he was looking at the annual report filled last year showing only $500M in shareholder's equity. As of the most recent 30June2021 numbers it is at $746,459,000. So roughly were my math was. The $200M jump actually occurred in Q2. Raising the the companies value by 40%.
