My mom is coming up on retirement and she told me a story about how she has to buy back 4 years of retirement bc she took it out during the .COM bubble. 

She withdrew $8K from her pension plan which accumulated over 4 years of working as a government official in Arizona. The stock market was going up so fast that she and her coworkers couldn’t afford NOT to invest. The plan was to make a quick 100% profit and then take her initial capital and put it back in the pension fund.

She only invested in strong companies that could not go down like Pets.com, microstrategy, and Amazon. At the pinnacle, her $8k investment became $19k, but she wasn’t about to paper-hand her golden ticket.

Then the bubble burst. Her original $8k turned into around $4K. She was scared of losing more, so she paper-handed pretty much at the bottom of the market. The irony is that if she had held her positions, they would have been worth a huge amount today.

Anyways, life got in the way so she never put the money back into the pension fund.

The reason this is the most epic loss porn is not because she went from $8k—>$19k—>4k, but because over 20 years later she has the money from selling a rental property to buy back her 4 years. However, the state pension plan is charging 8% compounded interest to buy back those years.

The total she has to pay is ~$55k! She has already decided to move forward with the payment to have a more comfortable retirement, but it essentially means she took an original $8K from her pension and turned it into a -$47k LOSS! 

Remember this when you try to yolo money you cannot afford to lose 🚀🚀🚀😎
