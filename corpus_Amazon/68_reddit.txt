# Based on [Statistica 2020 report](https://www.statista.com/topics/4076/amazon-prime/) AMZN has 213 Million Monthly Active Users, per latest 2020 10K report WISH has 107 Million Monthly Active Users.

This means that for every MAU Amazon makes roughly $1,500 and WISH makes $25. Eager to see WISH's 10Q earnings report in 10 days.

**In Conclusion** 

Unless new execs at WISH are brain dead (which they are not) [Reses and Co.](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210512005657/en/Wish-Announces-Appointment-of-Jacqueline-Reses-as-Executive-Chair) should be able to figure out how to monetize WISH's current massive MAU.

I am expecting the stock price to go much (*much much much*) higher as a result.
