I am considering getting few hundreds of Coupang's shares. Coupang is like the Amazon of south korea and is expanding to east and southeast asia. It is backed by softbank and is registered as a US company. I think it has a lot of potential.

Better get it at the dip since they just had a fire few months ago which affected the stock, It is also newly traded company.

## Key Points

* Coupang posted its 15th straight quarter of more than 50% year-over-year sales growth.

## Coupang's core business is still growing

Coupang's revenue rose 71% year over year (57% on a constant currency basis) to $4.48 billion, beating estimates by $50 million and marking its 15th consecutive quarter of more than 50% year-over-year constant currency sales growth.

analysts expect its revenue to rise 62% for the full year and for its bottom line to remain in the red. Coupang trades at just three times this year's sales, which is comparable to **Amazon**'s ([NASDAQ:AMZN](https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/amazoncom-inc/amzn/)) [price-to-sales](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/price-to-sales-ratio-value-stocks/) ratio.

I am open for suggestions
