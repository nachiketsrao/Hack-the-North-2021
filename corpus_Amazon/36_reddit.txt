—FUD #1: WISH’s revenue is going in the wrong direction.

Revenue year over year:

2015	$0.3 billion
 
2016	$0.7 billion
 
2017	$1 billion
 
2018	$1.2 billion
 
2019	$1.9 billion
 
2020	$2.5 billion
 
2021 (thru June) $1.4B (up 25% YoY)


—FUD #2: WISH only sells crap so it’s a crap company.

See numbers above. See 
Dollar General, Five Below, etc. The revenue and other companies that sell “crap” speak for themselves. 


—FUD #3: WISH is not worth its valuation.

Current market cap is $3.9B

WISH’s revenue this year alone will be approx. $3B. They also have about $1.4B in cash. 

Amazon offered $10B a few years ago. Institutions estimated the value around $17B in December at IPO. 


Forget the FUD and forget the hype. $WISH is severely undervalued right now. Not $69. Not $100. By year’s end and without the hype/FUD nonsense, it should be trading in the $11-13 range MINIMUM.

I believe the Executive team led by Jackie Reses knows how to bring WISH to new levels, and they’re highly incentivized by the share price with triggers in the $30+ range.
