As of August 23rd, there have been 9 institutions to open or expand their positions in funds or ETFs on $CLNE to include BlackRock, Fidelity, Morgan Stanley, and XOP. BlackRock has opened 3 new positions for 3 of their funds. Institutional purchases are not enough, but there are reasons they are buying.

The house democrats passed the $3.5T infrastructure bill that allocates $30B into renewable energy infrastructure, vehicles, and zero emissions over 5 years. We already know this and even though it is not priced in because politics are always risky to bet on, BP and Chevron have started making plays to purchase more RNG which will be handled through $CLNE owned facilities. As confirmed in a small tweet by the CLNE CEO  [Andrew J. Littlefair on Twitter: "All this RNG will go to Clean Energy stations thanks to our marketing deal with @bp Keep it coming!" / Twitter](https://twitter.com/A_Littlefair/status/1430628894709751808) . The final day for the bill to pass is set on September 27th so expect it to pass officially and written into law from now until then. The thing is that big gas and oil isn't getting into the RNG business. They don't want to just yet. They need RNG in order to meet the EPA regulations of bio-fuels mixtures, but realize that environmental regulations are only going to tighten. While the EPA is recommending to lower the mandated amount of bio-fuel mixed for the near future, because of a production slump due to COVID, it will rise again. What a better time to invest in RNG? It is a emerging market, but demand for most fuel is stagnant because of COVID's effect on travel.

The market is obviously growing, but why $CLNE? Well CLNE already has partnerships with BP, Chevron, Amazon, and Total to either provide RNG or provide the facilities for RNG because they have the infrastructure.
