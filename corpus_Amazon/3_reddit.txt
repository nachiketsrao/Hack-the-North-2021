We know software/newer tech sort of follows the Amazon playbook of growth at all costs without showing profits till later, so we can start by valuing it at price-to-sales.  Salesforce was always sort of a wall street hype stock, when they hit a $100B market cap around 06/2018, they had $11B in annual Rev and $3.6B per quarter for an ~8 price-to-sales.  In fact, in all their years public they never really broke through a 11 p/s ratio and to their credit, like ADBE, AMZN and other successful companies they actually grew into their valuations.

SNOW is almost at $100B with $270 mil per quarter.  Price to sales is around 100.  See the problem?

Others:

BILL - $28B market - 110 p/s

DDOG - $44B market - 55 p/s

ZS - $37B - 60 p/s

OKTA - $39B - 33 p/s

CRWD, COUP, SHOP, MDB, DOCU, DOCS, NET, MNDY, TEAM, U, etc

There are plenty more.. Zoom peaked in Oct of 2020 at a \~70 p/s and has been on a downslide since then. 

I think we’re a quarter of two away from a major crash in software. The pump can’t go on forever.  

Buyer beware, if you’re short, hang in there!
