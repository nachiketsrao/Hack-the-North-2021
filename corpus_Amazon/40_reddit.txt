tl;dr - Plantronics makes communication devices like headsets. 2022 FYQ2 guidance (particularly with respect to the chip shortage) has disproportionately lowered the price of the stock. There might also be a strong "return to work" boost in sales because enterprise's have been using services like Teams and Zoom while WFH, but as employees return to the office they will need to adopt a digital device rather than the traditional desktop anal log phone.

The ticket used to be called PLT and I bought it cause I thought it was Palantir. I actually made quite a bit of money (\~$200 / 25% return) So I decided to up the ante and try and play earnings and got completely slaughtered.

I've already lost the money, so this post isn't about trying to salvage those 8/20 calls I'm down 98% on. I just want to try and put my reasons for investing in this company out here for you wise men and retards at WSB to try and ask you, where did I go wrong?

Neil Armstrong said the first words on the Moon with a Plantronics headset. So when we Moon, I recommend POLY. I use them at work, they are great quality, (but expensive). POLY's main source of revenue is enterprise communications device sales.

I'm thinking that POLY will see a Return To Work boost. I don't think companies will go back to using analog devices. Many companies have been using Teams, Zoom, etc. to accommodate people working from home. Back in the early days, people just went on Amazon and bought whatever cheap USB / Bluetooth mic they could. POLY does not focus on the consumer device level, so unfortunately they did not profit from WFH. But when people start to come back to the office they will find themselves needing a new headset so they can communicate on Teams or Zoom. I guess they could dial in with their traditional office phone, but I don't think people will want to go back to doing that. As enterprises place orders for new Bluetooth and digital devices I envision they will stick with Plantronics.

After the Q1 22' earnings and subsequent guidance for Q2, the stock is currently down about 14%. Even though the guidance was not really bad news with both revenue and EPS forecast to increase.

I think there is room for a lot of room for upside with this company. They are making inroads into enterprise video devices (94% increase yoy). The chip shortage is improving, so Plantronics' gross margins will improve significantly. Finally, they have a new CEO who seems like a cool guy.

This is my first DD post. I don't really have any idea what I'm talking about, so if I missed some key points, please let me know, and it'll probably help me prevent something like the screenshot below from happening again lol.
