Most of the time on WSB, DD gets posted here AFTER a big move, retards pile on and YOLO near ATH's, the price eventually plummets and a new generation of ape bagholders are left behind with ruinous losses.

**This is not one of those times.**

As some of you already know, VIAC flew 7% today after a fantastic earnings report that blew the doors off nearly every metric. I know what you're thinking: welp, missed the boat on another one. And yes everyone, I'm the guy who posted the [10k earnings FD Yolo](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oxalfx/preearnings_10k_viac_fd_yolo/) couple days ago (sold those today and rolled them into LEAPS). Today was a GOOD day - aside from forgetting to screenshot BEFORE I sold for once in my damn life, typically I do the opposite and then never actually sell and lose all of it.

But this party is literally just getting started.

On Monday, Discovery (DISCA) [drilled](https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Discovery-Q2-Earnings-Snapshot-16359685.php) to the center of the earth off of strong earnings but dismal growth numbers, **falling 6%** and taking Viacom (which trades similarly to Discovery) along with it on the ride down. Ever since the Archegos collapse (more on that later but all of you know the Bull Hwang story by now), algos have undeservedly tied these two tickers at the hip. Subtract that undeserved 6% from today's 7% gain, and it pretty much cancels out: VIAC is **basically only up 1% off** of a truly fantastic earnings report. In fact, this stock was literally higher as recently as a week ago - and that's when earnings were a huge question mark, but no longer. For once, fellow apes would be getting in on the **GROUND FLOOR**.

**Q2 Earnings Highlights** (Don't feel compelled to read this part if you don't want to, TL;DR: they knocked it out of the park)

* Revenue: 6.56B (est 6.52B)
* Adj EPS: 0.97 (est 0.96)
* \+6.5M streaming subscribers (42M total between P+, Showtime etc)
* \+2.8M PlutoTV MAUs (52.3M total)
* \+45% watch time per user  (Roku's decreased)
* \+24% ad revenue yoy
* \+9% affiliate revenue yoy
* \+92% (!) streaming revenue yoy
* Paramount+ [officially launched in Europe](https://variety.com/2021/streaming/global/viacomcbs-sky-paramount-plus-europe-launch-1235035254/), expands in South America
* In this market you really need to pitch a perfect game to not get sold off on earnings. This was a clean sweep across the board: Viacom, priced like a value stock, just blew out all the growth stocks in growth metrics (looking at you Roku). And the best is yet to come (more on this later)

Ok let's review what Viacom even does for those who don't know. If you do know, skip this next part.

**1.** **The Business**

&#x200B;

[If you haven't watched something made by one of these brands there's just simply no way you live in America. ](https://preview.redd.it/k1j6my9sxmf71.png?width=665&format=png&auto=webp&s=69242a8e76eea2ce69f669d9d46ead5a9c0988cb)

Viacom basically owns every single TV channel you retards grew up watching. Nickelodeon, MTV, VH1, Comedy Central - from our childhood cartoons at Nickelodeon to the greatest comedy sketch show of all time (Chapelle's Show - no debate) to the shitty reality shows of the 2000's (Jersey Shore): Viacom owns ALL of it. It also owns Showtime which makes Billions, the unofficial TV show of WSB.

In a day and age where streaming content is at a premium, Viacom is sitting on an absolute TREASURE CHEST of content.

**How They Make Money**

* Advertising - Good old fashioned TV ads during programming (both traditional and streaming)
* Affiliate - The cut Viacom gets from the boomer retards who still pay their provider for cable TV
* Streaming Subscriptions - the 5 or 10 dollars a month from Paramount+ / Showtime
* Theatrical Releases - Did you know a Quiet Place 2 (made by Paramount) is the third highest grossing movie of the year behind Fast 9 and Black Widow? And cost a fraction of those to make? But yes, people still buy tickets to see movies (just ask the AMC apes, they know what's up).
* Licensing - Viacom doesn't keep all the content they make, they also license it out to others for LOTS of money. Much like a pimp that whores out prostitutes instead of keeping them all for his own sexual desires, VIAC is all about licensing money. HBO paid them half a BILLION for South Park. Amazon paid them 150 million for Coming 2 America, one of the shittiest sequels to a classic of all time. And as Netflix, Amazon, Apple all fight for content, fees are only going to go up. And all that money goes right back into fueling Viacom's sleeping giant: Paramount+

**Paramount Plus**

Even total retards know that traditional TV as we know is dying. Gone are the days where the whole family gathers around the tube to watch Modern Family at 9pm - these days everyone is on their own schedule, they mostly get their shows through streaming apps when they want it. More and more families are cutting the cable cord, opting instead to go with streaming apps like Netflix, Disney+, Amazon - with varying degrees of success. Streaming is the future - nothing new here.

Paramount+ is the brand spanking new streaming app that Viacom is banking on to contend with the big boys. The market has basically valued this venture at fucking zero - and you know what that was somewhat understandable: it's a crowded industry, the app hadn't existed for even a full quarter yet, the street wanted to take a "wait and see" approach.

Welp, Paramount just blew the fucking doors off all projections for their first full quarter and put to rest any doubts about the viability of the app. Between Paramount (and premium cable sister app Showtime), Viacom now has 42 million users, up from 36 when they last reported. And the biggest catalysts for growth are still yet to come!

Anyways, back to live TV's alleged slow death. There is one MAJOR exception to this. Sports. While we can catch our Billions episode on Tuesday night because we missed it Sunday and have basically the same experience, there is nothing more useless than a rerun of a sporting event. We need that shit LIVE, and it's basically the only kind of TV that has to be.

**Are you ready for some football?**

Did you know that the NFL accounted for 71 of the top 100 most watched live broadcasts in 2020? That's almost 75 fucking percent! In fact the NFL was responsible for $4 billion+ ad revenue for host networks in 2020 - and guess who just extended their NFL deal? When fall rolls around, P+ signups are going to fucking FLY as the CBS team broadcasts every AFC matchup this year, conveniently located in some top TV markets - Kansas City, Buffalo, Pittsburgh, and New England are all AFC / ViacomCBS territory, and all happy to look pretty decent this year unlike NFC teams New Orleans, Atlanta, and Chicago (but i'll save this convo for r/NFL).

Oh yeah, ViacomCBS also has the SEC college football rights too, the only conference in college football that even matters these days. American Football not your thing? They got the rights to real futbol too, including UEFA Champions league soccer and Serie A. More of a hoops guy? Guess who has the exclusive rights to March Madness. More of a boomer? Guess who has the PGA Tour.

With over 1000 live sporting events a year, Paramount Plus may actually be the most complete sports streaming app out there, surpassing even ESPN.

**Boomers still watch TV**

If you're reading this, take a moment to wipe the jizz off your pants from Viacom's sporting dominance as we review their more traditional businesses and check out some of these stats.

&#x200B;

[Wait, you mean to tell me ONE company has the top THREE dramas, top SIX comedies, #1 news show, and the #1 most watched show in the country on TOP of the NFL, SEC, PGA, NCAA, and soccer?! Even if you're not big on this stuff, you have to recognize how impressive that is. I for one don't watch a single one of these shows, but I know a lot of middle America \/ boomer generation absolutely still live by this shit. They aren't going away any time soon, as much as we might want them to. ](https://preview.redd.it/c32ujr09umf71.png?width=444&format=png&auto=webp&s=9170cca3860c60b53f42980660de08668eabc63e)

Don't believe this? Check out [Variety's report from May](https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/most-popular-tv-shows-highest-rated-2020-2021-season-1234980743/) about the most-watched TV shows on TV. Sheer CBS DOMINANCE.

[I'm assuming none of us watch any of these shows anymore unless it's to find new memes for WSB, but we all have a son \/ daugher \/ stepson as product of cuckery \/ sibling who is right in the Spongebob \/ Paw Patrol \/ Peppa Pig age range. No one, not even Disney, controls THIS much essential IP for the children's market. For parents, Paramount+ isn't a luxury, it's an absolute NECESSITY to shut their kids up.  ](https://preview.redd.it/45mxntowumf71.png?width=641&format=png&auto=webp&s=eaca6e55ff23254f30066b0c035aac5eaf949465)

The order isn't specified, but out of the [most popular children's television shows in America](https://www.fatherly.com/play/most-popular-kids-shows/), Viacom through Nickelodeon produces the vast majority of them.

Alright, enough about Paramount Plus. It's the key to VIAC's future, but we've covered enough of it. As P+ slowly begins to claim back it's IP it's licensed out to other streamers to bolster its own library and starts churning out some seriously great P+ exclusives (THE NEW [HALO](https://deadline.com/2021/02/halo-tv-series-latest-paramount-plus-move-1234698703/) TV SHOW for example) reasons to get the app will become more and more compelling over time - for sports fans, boomers, and parents especially. But what about for the poor people who don't want to pay even one penny for TV?

**Pluto TV**

Let me start this off by saying this: if you don't have Pluto TV, download that shit right now because it's free. Literally zero strings attached fucking free, don't even need to make an account with a fake email address, it's F R E E freeeeee. Whether or not you buy the stock, if you wasted all this time reading through all of this you will have at least gained the knowledge of the single greatest free cord cutting app ever invented.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v187qgwyvmf71.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=55c2638210fbbfa7b1f2268e90dced25e9570566

But how does Viacom make any money by giving you hundreds of channels and not charging you? You guessed it: ads. This nifty free app is expected to generate [1 BILLION](https://deadline.com/2021/08/pluto-tv-reaches-1-billion-annual-revenue-milestone-streaming-advertising-1234809600/) in advertising revenue for Pluto in 2021, well ahead of schedule. I have this on 8 hours a day in the background because BloombergTV is included, and it's absolutely fucking amazing. CBSHQ is a great ESPN replacement too for the sports fans that can no longer tolerate the irritating sounds of Stephen A Smith. Check it out, it's sweet. And free, you cheap fucks.

***TL;DR: Viacom is one of the most complete streaming TV stocks you can own right now, with something for everyone and strong competitive advantages in children's programming, live sports, and boomer television shows. It's the past, the present, and the future. They are taking the enormous cash flows that still continue to be generated from their linear TV business and investing the profits into the future of television: streaming - they're eating their cake and keeping it too.***

&#x200B;

2. **The Competitors (If you know the streaming space intimately, skip this part too)**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Contrary to popular belief, the SVOD pie is still growing even as we come out of the pandemic, and Viacom's share \(through Showtime and Paramount+, one of the only apps above to actually GAIN market share TWO straight quarters\) is expanding as well. Notice the 4&#37; DECLINE from Netflix between Q4 and Q2 2021 while Hulu and Disney have actually SHRANK as well. Time for a new sheriff in town?](https://preview.redd.it/uozq7ze0wmf71.png?width=564&format=png&auto=webp&s=6650e06867cfa58da7fee6c24c52cf5cb6492022)

**Netflix**

Those of you who thought Netflix runs this shit like Don Corleone are severely mistaken. While an early entrant and pioneer in the streaming space, growth has been hard to come by for Netflix thanks to a declining library, a refusal to compete in live sports or news programs, and more recently, a truly [bizarre foray into mobile gaming](https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585802/netflix-gaming-mobile-subscription-earnings). As you can see, Netflix, while still #1, is in decline - as the most expensive app, they seem to be coasting more on the Netflix brand name. And on the off chance they make a show someone actually likes, it's probably [canceled](https://www.businessinsider.com/best-canceled-netflix-shows-one-day-at-a-time-daredevil-2019-6).

**HBO + Discovery**

You're probably most familiar with HBO as the channel that fucked up Game of Thrones beyond repair, rendering a once global cultural phenomenon to being completely wiped out from the entire pop-culture consciousness. Discovery makes all the dogshit reality TV such as 90 Day Fiancee that is tearing down the fabric of American society. Other assets include TNT (home of Charles Barkley and I really don't know what else) and CNN (the world's leading purveyor of fake news).

Welp, they're all joining together. As of [May 17th](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/17/att-to-combine-warnermedia-and-discovery-assets-to-create-a-new-standalone-company.html), Discovery is merging with WarnerMedia - a deal structured so poorly that it sent Discovery shares from the $41 it was at premarket that day down to a paltry $29.20 today. Not all mergers are created equal, and this [reverse morris trust merger](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reverse-morris-trust.asp) successfully transferred AT&T's HBO bags to unsuspecting Discovery shareholders, resulting in a debt-ridden entity that hopes to compete in the very long run.

I'm not going to bash Discovery too much because I do think it has a chance to be relevant down the line, but this merger isn't closing for a WHILE and there's just not a whole lot of upside for the stock in the short term. The potential of being acquired is now gone.

**Disney**

Disney has deep pockets, and Disney+ combined with Hulu and ESPN is a strong portfolio. Their dual theatrical release + Disney+ streaming release combo business model is also used by Paramount, and may prove to be the standard moving forward. Disney+ has two of the world's most valuable IP of all time in Marvel and Star Wars, so you won't catch me talking shit about them here. They're a strong player here, and is the only one that could challenge Viacom's supremacy in children's content (although IMO Paramount targets the 5+ demographic while Disney is more in the 13+ space). Then again, Disney isn't a pure play streaming stock either (Disney World, Disney Land) so it's not a perfect comparison.

**Amazon / Apple**

Both of these FAANG stalwarts have made half assed efforts to compete in the streaming space without really dedicating any sort of resources to it since they have so much other shit going on. Bezos at least pretended to care for a while, showing up to the Emmy awards and shit before getting bored and fucking off to space. Apple's AppleTV effort has been dismal to say the least, with a content library of around 50 titles and a userbase composed almost entirely of free trials that won't be renewed. More on this later.

**NBC / Peacock**The only reason to have this shit app is for Office re-runs when you invite a girl over to Netflix and Chill. Ironically Netflix actually lost the Office to its original maker (just another L in a long series of NFLX L's) but Peacock and Chill does have a better ring to it anyways. Otherwise, this app is basically useless and is the least likely to survive the streaming wars independently without some sort of merger. Which brings me to my next point.

**ROKU -** only a competitor to PlutoTV, not really a competitor to Paramount+. Have you seen their P/E multiple?

&#x200B;

[Ok, I compiled the above myself and did my best to update through this quarter's ER's. It may not be ENTIRELY up to date or accurate, but I did the best I could since as far as I could tell there was nowhere else on the internet that had this info all in one place, I looked everywhere. Does not include Pluto TV, Tubi, Roku, or any of the free ad-based apps. ](https://preview.redd.it/hy2nnltqzmf71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdd1116b95dad14ad5388422ae22b3cb28d531db)

**VALUATION**

Ok, let's talk numbers, without which this is just paragraphs of drivel that no one is going to fucking read. If you apes made it this far by the way, I salute you. Here's where it gets fun. The below is sourced from a Google sheets template I built from scatch, sourcing from Google Finance and Finviz. I'll point out what I thought was noteworthy from each screen, but feel free to draw your own conclusions.

&#x200B;

[Check out that 52 week high column for Viacom and Discovery vs. where they are now. If you know the Bill Hwang story, you know what happened. If you don't, scroll down for a recap. This stock can get back there, we've seen it happen. ](https://preview.redd.it/ujkzehxh2nf71.png?width=1208&format=png&auto=webp&s=22f72af4802f60044764a58e33dc92d4906cb565)

[Viacom's RSI yesterday was 34 before today's ER, while it's still basically trading below all three SMA's. While these numbers are terrible, you'll see they pretty much suck across the entire sector \(check out the SMA stats on the streaming ETF\). It's a downtime for the streaming sector coming out of the pandemic with money flowing towards reopening plays, while high growth tech has been mooning thanks to a second collapse of the 10 year yield. I expect this entire sector to recover H2 2021 via sector rotation back into communications when the 10 year yield goes back up \(it's projected to double by year end\). ](https://preview.redd.it/f6nictey1nf71.png?width=958&format=png&auto=webp&s=5770c797fbc24c8ffda3967c96ae80b07d7273b0)

&#x200B;

[The important thing to note here is institutional onwership aka \\"the smart money\\". Viacom is a whopping 85+&#37; institutionally owned - asset managers, banks, hedge funds, pension funds, you name it. The short float number isn't high so I'm not going to lie to you about short squeeze potential. You'd have to be retarded to short here at 41 rather than back at 100 anyways.   ](https://preview.redd.it/pwc4c7ab4nf71.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3f86afe54becb04fce814a784d500a8e2719047)

&#x200B;

[Yes you are reading this correctly - Viacom trades at a paltry 9 P\/E and just 1 times revneue!!! Even compared to its peers in traditional TV, this is ludicrously low. Why should FOXA be higher despite not having a paid streaming app? Why does ROKU deserve to trade at a whopping 239 P\/E and Netflix at 54 P\/E? I'm not arguing that VIAC should be anywhere near those P\/E's, but with everything it has going for it, 9 is ludicrous. You're not going to find better-hidden value than this ANYWHERE in the S&P 500. Run a screen and sort by P\/E if you don't believe me.](https://preview.redd.it/e8jgc35v4nf71.png?width=1368&format=png&auto=webp&s=1daf37f3492e539bb9db61202d35f5d26776bcbe)

**3. ARCHEGOS aka Bull Hwang gets Margin Called (Skip if you know the history)**

I don't want to spend too much time on this story because all of WSB knows it for the most part. Legendary fund manager Bill Hwang blew up his account in a matter of days in true WSB fashion by being levered 20 to 1 in names such as Viacom, Discovery, Baidu, Tencent Music, IQiYi, and other assorted hilarity. With the bath that Chinese stonks have taken lately and the precipitous fall from 100 to as low as 38 in Viacom, it's easy to dismiss good old billy boy as just another retard in over his head.

But this guy saw something in Viacom. Instead of telling the entire Archegos story, i'll lay out the sequence of events as relates specifically to VIAC's share price.

[A lot of times, retards throw out random price targets that stocks will never hit in their entire existence. Here, we already know what VIAC is capable of. Sure it took a 20-1 levered Korean fund to get us there, but this glimpse to the past is actually a glimpse into our future. I'll hold off on naming an end of year price target myself though, I don't like doing that without building a full model which I just don't have the time for tonight. ](https://preview.redd.it/rul9xc7v6nf71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=34643da441c29a25656d6a79683e40d63c08e2b1)

[This chart would probably be more useful to reflect this week's price action, however since I made this whole thing from scratch it's going to take too long so fuck it. As you can see, streaming stocks have mostly all taken a breather since March. Getting in now is a classic buy low situation, something us apes really need to start trying for a change.  ](https://preview.redd.it/h48bqj886nf71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=72cbacf88a2561531bf19d1685159119d8763346)

**4. MERGER MANIA!!?**

WSB might be composed of a bunch of retards that barely know how the market work, but everyone knows this: if you own stock or options in a company and it gets bought out, it is the FASTEST and most satisfying path to tendies. Strategic acquisitions are known to pay a [much higher premium](https://labusinessjournal.com/news/2021/jul/19/stamps-com-acquired-7-billion/) to what a company is trading for on the open market. There's no better way to exit a position than waking up to an alert that something you own has been acquired.

At least that's how Discovery shareholders felt the morning of May 17th before ***discovering*** they weren't getting bought out, they were getting CEO Zaslav's turd sandwich of a merger in which AT&T dumped HBO and all their associated debt on Discovery shareholders, who only get a paltry 29% of the new entity while AT&T holders get 71%. AT&T holders fared no better as the announcement accompanied the news that AT&T had to nuke their dividend to get this deal done, which was the only reason to own that POS to begin with. It was a rare deal in which everyone loses, except Zaslav himself.

But while DISCA owners were left holding their dick's, a world of possibilities were opened up for the remaining players in the streaming space to be acquired by the giants. Shortly after Amazon acquired the private MGM studios, which basically only has James Bond at this point. Much speculation ensued about whether the remaining players (VIAC, Lionsgate, AMCX, CURI) would be acquired by the giants of Netflix, Apple, Amazon, Disney etc.

I'm not going to sit here and lie to everyone and say a merger is imminent, I have no fucking clue. What I do know is Shari Redstone, chairwoman and largest stakeholder, is finally [open](https://www.wsj.com/articles/comcast-ceo-brian-roberts-and-viacomcbs-chairman-shari-redstone-met-to-discuss-streaming-partnership-11626743478) to shopping Viacom, something her father would have never considered. With a complete portfolio of sports, children's, and boomer linear, no acquisition would fix Amazon or Apple's lackluster TV efforts than Viacom. However, I don't think Viacom needs to be acquired, I think they have a legitimate shot of being a player in this space on their own.

**TL;DR We don't need to be bought out for tendies, but it sure wouldn't hurt. No acquisition would be more attractive than Viacom to immediately turn a tech giant into a streaming powerhouse. It's merely the difference between mooning sooner vs. mooning later. Either way, Shari's listening.**

**5. Analyst Price Targets**

Upgrades are coming. With earnings this good, we're already starting to see upgrades TODAY from analysts who weren't too lazy to pass in their work by EOD.

&#x200B;

[Bank of America also has a 53 PT from last quarter. I would expect further upgrades from the rest of the street tomorrow. ](https://preview.redd.it/mixl44gu8nf71.png?width=473&format=png&auto=webp&s=be78d48b7c413066e1372b36ce1a7646df207a58)

Even Without accounting for the new upgrades from today or tomorrow, the average VIAC price target is still $50.34, representing a 21% upside.

**6. Conclusion**

I wanted to get into some technincal analysis of this thing (cup and fucking handle anyone???) as well as risk factors but I'm out of time, I'll save those for a Part 2. Will be happy to answer any questions in the comments.

**TL;DR: Viacom has been consolidating for over 4 months and is finally about to fucking blow the roof off after showing phenomenal growth in a space primed for industry consolidation. This is the best positioned streamer as far as IP goes, and an acquisition would moon this basically immediately (while not essential to the investment thesis, it would be nice of course).**

**Forget the moon, forget Uranus, we are going to PLUTO.**  [🚀](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/)

**7. Position**

[ignore the XBI, this was the easiest way to fit it all on one screen since RH still sucks ](https://preview.redd.it/0sqeaecqanf71.png?width=341&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf0b8bcfe3b13a6a8b80fe3937769b6e0870e1bf)

EDIT: This blew up more than I thought it would. I've never posted DD here before but the overwhelmingly positive reaction I've received from this has inspired me to contribute more to the community. Now, initially I was going to make a separate Part 2 post but I don't want to be seen as spamming so I'm just going to put it as a comment and add it as an edit. Besides, it's probably important to have the risk factors of the trade as part of the original post.   


**8. RISK FACTORS**

Alright everyone. Some of you read the whole thing and YOLOed. Some of you didn't read any of it and still YOLOed. Most of you probably didn't do shit. And that's ok, because I want everyone to read this next part first before deciding. 

* **The entire market could crash** like the gay bears have been promising for months. This would of course take out everything with it, and VIAC is no different. The 10% Correction gets thrown out regularly, I'm not an economist so I really don't know if or when this is going to happen - although most of us will have way bigger problems than just VIAC if that does occur. 
* **The decline of linear TV outpaces the growth of streaming.** This is the worst case scenario for Viacom: advertisers pull their dollars out of linear which has been a cash cow and reallocate them elsewhere (i.e. NOT streaming), leaving Viacom underfunded for P+ growth. I must acknolwedge the potential risk of this even though I assign a very low probability to this in the short term since Viacom just completed the [best ad buying upfront they've ever had](https://deadline.com/2021/06/viacomcbs-upfront-paramount-pluto-tv-cbs-nfl-1234783415/). That article is a good read because it's not just Viacom tooting its own horn, it's the entire industry! If anything it paints a fairly rosy picture of where the money is flowing. 
*  **The P+ app fails to gain traction**. Paramount plus has seen two straight quarters of new user growth while Disney and Netflix have actually declined. However, it's certainly easier to gain new users when you're app is new. We don't know if something will keep growing at the rate it has. Reddit and Twitter do have their fair share of people bitching about the P+ app as far as content availability (some seasons of some shows are still [licensed out](https://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/2021/05/paramount-plus-missing-real-world-challenge-seasons/) to competitors and the short term) and bugs (the Playstation app is apparently abysmal while the other apps work much better - I've never had an issue on my Samsung or Fire apps). The bottom line is that while P+ has the same growing pains of any new app, the devs do need to figure their shit out, do their fucking job, and keep complaints at a minimum. 
* **Competition** \- The competitors in this space have DEEP pockets. All 5 FAANG names have some sort of video platform, Netflix is of course the leader here, and Apple and Amazon have at least made half assed attempts to be players in this space. A strategic shift from either Apple or Amazon to suddenly start pumping cash into these efforts could prove to be a threat for the survival of Viacom as a viable independent player. The silver lining here however is that should they choose to do that (Apple especially has done basically jack shit) - the easiest way to suddenly increase their position would actually be to buy Viacom's vast IP.  
* **Merger.** But wait, wouldn't a merger be a good thing like you said earlier before? Not always, and unfortunately Discovery already laid a very recent, very relevant blueprint for why not all deals are good deals are shareholders. I've seen a similar deal pitched in which Comcast unloads NBC Universal onto Viacom in a reverse morris trust merger; I would expect that to do to our share price what the Warner deal did to Discovery's. If we are going to get acquired, it better be all cash or all stock, and at a valuation that reflects our true value. I think Shari Redstone is actually our friend on this, she won't screw us the same way Zaslav fisted his shareholders. Conversely, if Viacom suddenly decides they want to be a buyer rather than a seller, history dictates that it's the acquiree's share price that moons while the acquirer's share price that takes a hit. There's no guarantee that the long-established 38 price floor will hold in the event of strategic M&A. Given the [ludicrous valuation](https://variety.com/2021/film/news/reese-witherspoon-hello-sunshine-sold-1235032618/) Hello Sunshine just got, I would much rather be a seller than a buyer in this market. 
* **Dividend.** In my infinite retardation I somehow managed to forget to mention this stock pays a fucking healthy dividend too, which is probably a factor as to why we have so much institutional ownership. A dividend cut of course would hurt the share price. I see the probability of this as basically near zero, the balance sheet looks pretty good right now. 
* **The Options Pinning Theory**. A lot of people are claiming this stock only exists to kill weekly options, but on most weeks I don't see enough open interest for that to actually be worth it for MM's. One thing is certain though, all calls bought after Archegos expecting a bounce to the 80-100 range got nuked. Thus far, call selling has been a more profitable trade than call buying MOST of the time. While personally I think shares and leaps look like the play here (my position currently reflects that also), any time this thing dips below 40 is when to go in with FD's as it very rarely spends too much time below there. For the more conservative investor, SELLING 38 puts is literally free money. 
* **Archegos -** Some say there is an Archegos curse, that nothing in the Korean hedge fund is ever going to moon again. I mean this is some voodoo shit but I feel like it has to be included here. The Chinese stocks he held are obviously down for entirely different reasons right now, and it just hasn't been a hot time for the value / comm trade, something I expect to reverse H2. 
* **The Growth Trade Never Fucking Ends.** As most of us know the tech trade was basically left for dead earlier in the year as shares of tech stocks tumbled as the ten year yield started to rise up steadily. This trade has reversed, and all the money has since gone back into tech, particularly the megacaps. The growth trade has been at the expense of the value trade, and make no mistake about it, ***VIAC IS A VALUE TRADE (LOOK AT THE P/E). It's listed on the NASDAQ, but don't call this a tech stock, it's a communications stock***. While it does look like the ten year yield has stopped drilling with today's nice bounce, there's no guarantee it doesn't once again reverse. However, I have a really difficult time seeing it going below 1%, and I'd be the whole house on the fact it ends the year closer to 2% than 1%. As the yield goes back up, they will shift the money from the growth trade back into value, which benefits VIAC. 
* **SPEAKING OF ALGOS** \- What does it mean to be heavily institutionally owned? Share price movements are more algo-induced from the big boys. They'll trade many stocks together simultaneously in the same industry, which at times can be unfortunate if you're grouped together with subar competitors. Layer a VIAC chart over DISCA between May and yesterday and you'll see what I mean, when one goes down so does the other. Today's price movement has been encouraging though, I have never seen VIAC green while DISCA is red I think ever. A decoupling here would be fantastic. 
* **The 38 Price Floor I believe in might not hold -** for all the reasons I included above, shit could go south, but this floor has stood the test of time and all sorts of wild shit this year. If it can survive the greatest margin call in history, and every retest after that, then this 38 floor is safer than any other investment I can think of since I don't know the floors of any other stock. But something only works until it doesn't right? So I'm including this as a risk factor since much of the thesis is based upon it. 
* **TL/DR:** There are risks to this trade as there are with any trade, and from the above it's wiser to go with a longer term trade in LEAPS form as much of this stuff takes longer to develop. I'd only go FD's if it dips below 40 as it doesn't spend much time below it. But when factoring in the growth potential, the safety of the 38 floor, the dividend, and the acquisition potential, this play really does have it all for me. Trade safely apes.
