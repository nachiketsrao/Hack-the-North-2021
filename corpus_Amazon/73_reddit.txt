Did you come to Wallstreetbets today to browse Bear Porn? Whelp, this is definitely **not** the post for you. If, on the other hand, your nipples are rock hard for the future, then here's the chart-filled masturbation material you've been searching for! In novella form, because I don't understand what 'brevity' means. But I do understand ***America Fuck Yeah***, because I listen to it every morning before the opening bell!

**Part 1. Future-ology**

There is not going to be a *Mother of All Crashes*. It's just not going to happen. Instead, this decade we are going to see the **Mother of All Rallies** *-- s*o named because it lends itself to the acronym **MARs** (which we might also reach by the end of the decade).

Future Bro-ism will be the impetus for this coming melt-up that's going to get us all fantastically rich. Among the list of buzzwords tossed about, I'm predicting "**AI**" and "**machine learning**" will the ones underpinning this epic, once-in-a-generation event.

While EV and the general move away from fossil fuels looks good on paper, from a market-perspective it is mostly shifting money from one area to another (currently less efficient) area. Powering everything with nuclear helps with the efficiency and I expect there to be some sweet nuclear plays just around the corner (e.g., Gates' new test reactor in Wyoming). However, unless (and until) nuclear ***fusion*** reactors become a thing, I don't think energy is much more than the stable, dividend paying play its been for so very long now.

On the other hand, "AI" and "machine learning" have limitless upward potential... ***in the minds of the masses***. The actual potential is certainly overblown, and the actual progress is not nearly as far enough along to support the wildest claims. However, from the market's perspective that doesn't matter. The only important thing is: "*Can I envision this fundamentally changing the human condition*?" If the answer to this question is "Yes," then you have the potential for a **massive** speculative rally. With AI/machine learning, the answer is a definitive **yes**.

Because the topic is so far beyond the average person's ability to understand, they will fill that "bucket of what could be" with all their joys and hopes and dreams, which will in turn lead to mindless buying of everything associated with this concept. We are already seeing this and I do not expect it to stop. To the contrary, I'm calling out a considerable acceleration of the speculation.

Further, like the Dot Com bubble, I expect a massive spillover from the core names in this space into any and everything conceivable. Again, we're already seeing the signs of this, with the tags "AI" and "machine learning" being slapped onto all manner of companies, just like "dotcom" got tagged onto random shit back in the day.

**Part 2. The Charts**

"But everything is overvalued already!" First, even if that's true, it doesn't matter nearly as much as you think it does. But more to the point: **no**.

"Bro, the actual fuck are you talking about? Look at the S&P 500 long term! This is bananas bro! It's the hockey-stick formation!":

[It needs to go to like 200 to get back in the channel, dipshit!](https://preview.redd.it/0w58sqvuwde71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4aaf47efddac006bb4bd7e65a6ce63f5bc191d0)

&#x200B;

But Cbass is a wunderkind of TA, and I've discovered this magic button that says, "log". Let's try pushing it!

[Oh, that's actually not bad at all....](https://preview.redd.it/c34y1vz4xde71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=e76a57ab1e42b6d15bc32a1d28255f75e4613691)

As you can see, we are just ***slightly*** above the 90-year channel. Yes, historically, reaching the top of the channel has resulted in a rejection back to the mid-line, but we just came off the mid-line. What I'm seeing here looks more like a full blown breakout than a rejection, *a la* the 90's.

&#x200B;

Next up, let's check the Nasdaq:

[Back to the mid-line](https://preview.redd.it/79f8nfs1yde71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=a016fcb14808bbdac40bf9b100d556af7e186056)

I'm sure someone will vehemently disagree with the channel I've drawn here, because the index was so far under it for so long. I think that's just a reflection of the general under-performance of the garbage that ends up listed on the Nasdaq that would never get on the S&P.

&#x200B;

Still, to be accommodating, here is the channel from the '09 lows:

[Bear Porn, nsfw](https://preview.redd.it/h10oxds6zde71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc1dd2ed7994e6106d597734c47301fadb43bf70)

This is the best case for the Bears, but always remember Cbass's First Law of TA: you can always find a chart & indicator combination to tell you what you want to hear.

Also, the Nasdaq 100 chart doesn't look nearly as good for my case:

[I don't like this, so let's not address it](https://preview.redd.it/fwca041t1ee71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2fd79367f6ef8c59505ffd51bb0f4e5d584ab5f)

Seriously, though, this channel doesn't line up well with the overall index. I suppose you can say the Big Boys are due for a haircut, but I'm not waiting around for that. If you adjust it so the '08 crash is under the channel, then this too is around the mid-line.

&#x200B;

Indulging in some fantasy for a moment, let's predict where the Nasdaq would be with a rally of similar scope to what happened in the Dot Com era:

[707&#37; from the mid-line to the top](https://preview.redd.it/uv3dgj650ee71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=adc04b09a8cca96e483fa7f7b9577bb0c30ef6b3)

So I added a sixty percent to the mid-line to top rally because ***America*** (and also this lands us nicely at 120,000 points). We're likely to intercept the top of the channel somewhere around 30,000 to 40,000 depending on how long this next phase is, but I think we get to **at least there**. I have the rally lasting until 2030, but as George Lucas says, "it rhymes, like poetry," so look to '29 for the crash.

&#x200B;

Next up, let's look at the SPX in Cbass's fantasy land:

[SPY calls for all](https://preview.redd.it/v82hej6p2ee71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=272b65ef48476cae8800ed3ea11c97159cc86e8c)

Here I've gone rally-start to rally-end with the same percent increase, so that would be from the pandemic bottom (which was the mid-line anyway, just like in the Dot Com rally). This puts the target at about 7,800. Again by the end of the decade. Like last time we had a breakout, I don't think the S&P is going to benefit as much as the Nasdaq.

&#x200B;

**Part 3. Burry, Pooh Bear & the Taper Tantrum**

Straight out of the gate: Michael Burry was inevitable. There was always going to be a Michael Burry and there will again be another Michael Burry.

"Why?" you might ask.

Answer: Because every day there is someone, somewhere, predicting the stock market is on the brink of a collapse. Many of them have good reasons, too. Indeed, I'm willing to bet that every single year someone makes a well-reasoned case for why the stock market is due for a crash with good data to back it up. There is always a bear case and there ***always will*** be a bear case.

But one cursory look at the long term charts should tell you the true answer: these guys are wrong ***way*** more often than they are right. But because one of them will eventually be right, people keep listening. And the things you spend time listening to are going to affect your outlook on life. If you spend all day browsing bear porn, you'll get to thinking you should be holding nothing but cash, or gold, or silver, or gourd futures.

Worse than that, once one of these bears is inevitably correct, that person is elevated to sainthood and his continued predictions of doom are feasted upon by the masses, compounding the missed opportunities and future regret of those poor bastards that bought into yet another Prophet of Doom.

&#x200B;

There are, of course, some choppy waters ahead. I'm not talking about evictions, or student debt, or government debt, or any of that nonsense. The market is going to steamroll through that shit like it doesn't exist.

China, however, could be a real problem. If the Pooh Bear decides to do something unexpected, then we're going to get a crash and a bad one. But he's not going to do shit. I promise you he won't. He likes money and not being incinerated by nuclear fire. The Chinese stock sector is going to be rough waters for the traders and risky for the holders, but the rest of the market will just move on.

The taper tantrum is the next real threat, and it **is** going to happen. But it's not going to lead to the Mother of All Crashes; rather, I'm thinking it'll be a great dip-buying opportunity. The 'priced in' joke is probably getting a bit worn at this point, but the TT **is priced in** for the most part. We all know it's coming, because it's being telegraphed hard. That means as we approach it there will be pull backs and some flat trading that are indicative of the market taking the "big event" into consideration. You can already see this with each Fed meeting. Nevertheless, when it ~~starts to happen~~ *is announced* I still expect a sizable correction, and I'm going to scrounge up some cash for that dip buy. The other side of the TT will be a ripper.

**Part 4. Blizzards of Cocaine**

Friends, colleagues, distinguish investors and professors of economics, I implore you to see reason. How often are the bears actually right? How many failed predictions of doom must we suffer through before the truth is seen? How many incredible, face ripping rallies must you miss before it sinks in?  You worry about a drop caused by inflation, and so you keep your money in the dollar, the *very thing devalued by inflation*?

The path before us is clear, friends. We've broken out of the channel on the SPX, and thus the sky is the limit. With each next human achievement: the space flights of rich assholes, the cars that look like they came from Back to the Future, the Amazon Drone Mothership that will have your package delivered in an hour, and most of all: the magic of "***machine learning***", a thing no understands but everyone will pin their hopes of tomorrow on -- all this will see us clear these troubled days and onward to ***the greatest rally of all fucking time.***

Put your money on the table, ladies and gentlemen, because ahead, there on the horizon, is your new yacht, your model girlfriend (^(made to order)), your overpriced Italian sports car, and an ***actual blizzard of cocaine!***

&#x200B;

***Good luck, and may the lambos be with you.***

&#x200B;

Positions relative to this post are tiny, but still:
