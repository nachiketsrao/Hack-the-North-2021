I have never had the stones to buy options, but maybe now is the time? 

Other than the ridiculous spike at the beginning of 2021, Baidu has traded down over 5 years. The 1 year is skewed, but if we look back at day for day, it was about $120 against current day $150. So if I had bought and held through the spike I would have still been up a very decent 25% in 1yr.

Now, Baidu has a P/E of about 7. Compare to Baba at about 23, Tencent about 21.5, JD is at 14. Stateside, mega giants Google is at 30 and Amazon is running a 57 P/E. 

Financials: assets have climbed steadily every year. They’re cash positive with money in the bank. Net Income in 2020 was about 22.5B. 

Almost every analyst I’ve read says this stock is undervalued. $200 seems assured, and long term… who knows? 33% ROI is great, but 100% if it gets anywhere near ATH would be fantastic. 

The big audacious goal he is their AI. They are the leader in China here, and I believe this will allow them some explosive growth in the future as autonomous driving becomes a reality, online search becomes increasingly driven by AI, and cloud business. This should allow it to rise above the competition from Bytedance, Tencent, Alibaba, and others for search revenue. 

The obvious elephant in the room is the Chinese government crackdown on… everything. Short term, makes this very volatile. Long term, I think things stabilize and Baidu will be well positioned when it does. 

If I did try and jump into options, I’m not sure how I would approach it. Would love to hear your thoughts (obviously not financial advice). 

Position: 30 shares at $192.

TL:DR - Baidu is undervalued with a P/E half or better than competitors. China be crazy but I believe their net cash, growing revenue, and AI research will position them for 100% growth in 12-24 months. Conservative fair value is $200-$210.
