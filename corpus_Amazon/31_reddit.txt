Obviously this ain't financial advice, just my autistic thought process.

inb4 anybody looks down their nose at me through their fkn nerd glasses this is wallstreetBETS, not r/investing. 

First of all I sure as hell don't understand technical analysis so fuck your charts and logic, nor do I understand what the fundamentals of a business even are. What tf is an EBITDA anyway? 

What I technically understand is that fundamentally nearly every single fucking retard I know smokes weed. Obviously people are buying this shit. Low wage workers are not the only people smoking weed, I know biologists and chemists of varying backgrounds who are tokin' on the reg. Messing around with the devils lettuce will pass cigarettes, vaping, and drinking the crazies in popularity among the younger generations in NA. Vaping is trashy, cigarettes are gross and drinking causes hangovers. 

Maybe some of you roll your eyes at this, but I do think you're underestimating the near-term upside potential of the weed industry in general. Obviously some of this has to do with the US government (no politic) and I'll do my best to convince you why some regulation is coming and soon. Regulation is the biggest barrier for this industry to hurdle but there are other reasons to be optimistic; high demand, medical benies, drinks, market consolidation, cbd, growing revenues, operational efficiency. 

I basically have three reasons for believing the marijuana industry is about to go to the moon that all boil down to basically the only thing holding back this industry: fkn big gov regulation.

&#x200B;

**Evolving Industry:**

This industry is evolving by making lots of different products sure, but even more so in that there are fewer and fewer mom and pops. Getting some kind of product out the door was easy enough, grow pot -> sell pot, but there's now guys in lab coats doing some [crazy magic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pW66iiVNJtY). 

Another thing to note within this industry is that there have been many acquisitions or mergers; currently that's slowing down, but regulation will help speed this up across the US as many states have already legalized pot on some level. There is a lot more to come and I'm sure that bigger players who could become a swift force in the industry will time their entry.

States across the US and companies in Canada are realizing that we can produce more pot than we will ever smoke and they've gone through/are still going through the growing pains from this. The US has a more significant problem in that cannabis growers can only sell to retailers within their state. Canada is currently figuring out the best way to handle production. When growers are able to do interstate commerce there will be over supply, but what follows is consolidation and operational efficiency. 

The sheer amount of different marijuana products being created is ridiculous, but there some that I think could change the industry. Something that can be mass produced like pills, drinks or marijuana cigarettes.

**Popularity/demand:**

There are supposedly a whole lot of medicinal benefits to weed; whether or not they are for yuppies is up to you, but they buy it. And there are some real notable medical applications in some neurological disorders. The point is that they make this shit into a million different kind of products. There's raw pot, joints, edibles, drinks, oils, topicals, cosmetics, and they all have different flavors and variations. The drinks are probably the most important product for this industry. How easy was it to give this stupid hard seltzer fad a try? Dirty bongs, pipes, baggies o' ganja and blow torches understandably produce aversion in people, but a can stored in a cooler/fridge has a lot of appeal.  

Aside from the potential of something like a canned drink becoming fashionable the [popularity](https://news.gallup.com/poll/353645/nearly-half-adults-tried-marijuana.aspx) of the old dirty stuff is [sizable](https://news.gallup.com/poll/323582/support-legal-marijuana-inches-new-high.aspx). These days in my conservative state where marijuana is illegal the common conversation around marijuana goes a few different ways; at best, its open support for legalization and at worst, its something like, "I don't think they should go to jail for it." 

The market projections upon legalization are [huge](https://www.forbes.com/sites/irisdorbian/2021/06/18/legal-cannabis-market-projected-to-rack-up-43-billion-by-2025-says-new-study/?sh=58a7906c36b4). This alone ought to convince most autists that there is a rocket ship loading up. 

**Regulation:**

I think that rocket ship is going to being taking off soon. I don't want to get too far into the politics of this, but I can say that the stars might just align. Appetite for regulation is highest on the Blue team, but that isn't to say that there is no appetite on the Red team. The blues have control of the government and the [head blue himself gathered some of the other top blues and introduced a discussion draft and plan to end discussion on Sep 1](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/14/schumer-launches-long-shot-bid-for-legal-weed-499584). That's pretty soon, js. 

Most of you are probably shaking your heads and thinking that politicians promise all kinds of things and you're right. I'll just say that I'm a bit of a political nerd, I was an intern on the hill and I listen and read lots of news. I only say this, because the following explanation of my analysis is probably going to be incoherent. So, many politicians, especially the ones you most often see on TV promise all kinds of things, but Senate Majority Leaders literally set the agenda for the senate. They cannot overpromise, because they actually have the power to do something. Average lawmakers can always overpromise, because when they don't achieve their goals they have reasonable excuses. Obviously even majority leaders with the full support of the rest of the government can fail; for example, when McCain voted  to prevent McConnell from passing ACA repeal. [Marijuana regulation has passed in democratic house in the past](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-55191808). So the senate and the presidency are where the action is happening. The president has expressed willingness to sign decriminalization regulation. His language during the debates and in his campaign platform pointed to decriminalization and restorative justice. This is a small issue for him, but given its widespread popularity and campaign promises it is an easy political win for him to sign. Vetoing and refusing to sign in the case that this did pass would severely damage the Blues just before a midterm. The senate is going to begin debating reform soon, according to the leader of the senate. 51 liberal votes and 50 conservative votes. Although a couple liberals in the senate have voiced opposition to national recreational legalization, no one has opposed decriminalization, which is likely where debate will end up. But you need 60 votes anyway, so let's talk about the Reds. Several conservative states have legalized marijuana recreationally and even more medically, so the politics for them is complicated and not all of those will support legislative efforts. Decriminalization is an easy 'states rights' conservative appeal. Some states will likely keep marijuana criminalized. The Reds support is the most sensitive. The story with conservative support is that you have some libertarian leaning, young, ambitious senators on the red team. The young and/or ambitious senators (think Josh Hawley, Rand Paul, or even Cruz), especially on the red team, will potentially see an opportunity to take the side of a popular issue among young voters (a demographic they would like to make competitive in roads with). The red's opposition is a hardline as long as we talk about "legalization," but as the debate continues we will begin to talk about "decriminalization," which would allow states to determine criminality and also open barriers for the marijuana industry to thrive. The biggest obstecle for the reds is really the restorative justice efforts, reds are usually of the mindset that those people in jail still deliberately broke the rules. The debate will be messy, but this betting man says that we'll land on either decriminalization or interstate commerce regulation. Either way we're going to tendie town bby. 

It is absolutely notable that one of America's largest employers, Amazon(has a mansion in DC for smoozing), supports federal regulation.

[Wonder who he entertains in such a house](https://preview.redd.it/87w0hwdreej71.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=8077295f25f590f66cfd28455166f33a1e1b6628)

All in all, the near-term potential hinges on federal regulation (which I bet is coming through soon), but we all know that long-term its a win.
