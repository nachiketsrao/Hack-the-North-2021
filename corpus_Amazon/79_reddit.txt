Let me start this off with I know, China has a grip on their economy, a tight one. But I believe the K-9 to k-12 non profit is completely unrelated to Alibaba.

The most common thing I here is buy the fear, but everytime there is fear everyone is running from it.

Alibaba is Chinas amazon, and I do not think at any time China will pull the rug out on that. You may correct me if you think im wrong but looking at this from an outside view that is how I feel. 

Alibaba in my opinion is very undervalued due to chinas current stance right now so obviously it is a high risk but I believe it is an even higher profit if they arent pulling the rug from $BABA as I think they wont. 

Please if you have any other DD to include on baba let me know as Im open to hearing Bull and bear cases from both sides.
