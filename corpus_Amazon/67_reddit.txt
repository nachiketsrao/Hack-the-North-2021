# BACKGROUND INFO

23andMe has been trading on the NASDAQ for just over a month.

Prior to being listed as $ME - it was being traded as a SPAC  - A shell company created by Sir FUCKING Richard Branson a.k.a. the biggest virgin on the planet. (Owner of Virgin Atlantic Airways and Virgin Mobile and a bunch of other companies).

If you don't know, 23andMe is a saliva based testing kit which can be sent to your home. It's completely retard-friendly. All you have to do is send them a sample of your already overflowing drool. With this sample, they can complete genetic testing and analyze changes in DNA structure and sequence.

According to the 23andMe kit I am 69% Neanderthal. This explains my sloped forehead and why I dream in IMAX.

When it was announced that Richard Branson's SPAC would acquire 23andMe - it shot up to a high of $18.16 from an average of $10. (This was prior to 23andMe even being listed.) After the initial rise and fall, the price settled back to $10 and was kept there until the shareholders could vote on the acquisition of 23andMe.

23andMe is backed not only by Richard Branson but is headed by CEO and co-founder of $ME - Anne Wojcicki. She is sister to Susan Wojcicki (Current CEO of Youtube). Anne was also married for a while to Sergey Brin (co-founded of Google).

She developed 23andMe after working as a health care investment analyst for a San Francisco investment fund . She was displeased with the way investment firms viewed biotech's and set out to create her own world-changing company.

# POTENTIAL

Originally, 23andMe offered tests which would map out your genetic make-up i.e. your ancestry. God knows your ancestors who migrated from Africa hundreds of thousand of years ago are looking down on you with immense shame.

In 2015 the FDA gave 23andMe approval for tests which could include various types of cancers, Alzheimer's, cystic fibrosis, Parkinson's, sickle cell anemia, Gaucher's disease, early onset dystonia, and many more hereditary ailments.

Also in 2015 they announced a partnership with GlaxoSmithKlien to use the genetic mapping of over 5 million customers to design new drugs.

In 2020 GlaxoSmithKlien announced their first joint clinical trial regarding cancer treatment - working with client DNA they had gotten from 23andMe.

$ME has a potential DATA MINE of genetic information. Imagine knowing if a certain illness runs in your family and your own propensity for it - with information like this ahead of time, one can be more easily prepared and can catch it even before symptoms start.

Easy to use and streamlined tests like this are the future. The technology will only get better and medications will only improve with the amount of people opting to have their DNA analyzed further by 23andMe & their partners.

# METRICS / DATES

23andMe TEST KITS WERE ONE OF THE TOP 5 SELLERS THIS YEAR ON AMAZON'S PRIME DAY.

AUGUST 13th, 2021 - 11:00AM EDT is 23andMe's 2nd Quarter Earnings Call!

As I said before - the price went from $10 to a high of $18.16 even before the merger. Yesterday $ME closed at $8.23 (Ending in the aftermarket at $8.35). This is LOWER than pre-merger prices and we're still in the EARLY DAYS of the company.

Put in a stop loss and see where this thing goes. The long-term upside is enormous and the downside is scarce. You'd currently be paying LESS than what early investors paid.

**52 week HIGH - 18.16**

**52 week LOW - 7.72**

**$3.19B MARKET CAP**

\---

Get in low while you can. Now would be a great time to buy ahead of earnings.

Maybe if we all come together, we can have the 23 chromosomes required to be labeled as a 'normal functioning human being.'

**TL;DR & ELI5:** 23andMe ($ME) has huge names behind it. Potential is high. Earnings are on the 13th. Prices are a steal. I hope you enjoyed my Ted-Talk.
