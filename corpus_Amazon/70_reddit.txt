Im going to be making post on earnings. The first one I am going to be reviewing is Amazon since it’s the most anticipated earning report of the day. Amazon did not impress anyone. Net sales were 106bn-112bn, which is short of the 118.62bn estimate. Amazon not beating sales is a huge blow, and that’s why the stock is trending down around 6% after hours. They did beat EPS however, but I do see a short-term skid after these earnings. And take note that $AMZN has huge weight in the indexes. So this might start a blood fest in the market as a whole.
