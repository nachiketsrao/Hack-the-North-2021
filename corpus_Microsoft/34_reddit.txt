Here's a short DD on why I think TWST is the best pick going for both short and long term returns:

&#x200B;

1. Genomics stocks are volatile, but with potential for huge returns. One way of getting exposure is by buying companies developing the actual medicines (think CRSP, EDIT, NTLA). These are a bit of a lottery tho as you don't really know if they will pass clinical trials. TWST on the other hand, manufactures DNA to be used in the types of aforementioned companies' research. Therefore, by owning TWST you can get exposure to the industry without being exposed to one company or another having a successful or not clinical trial for a certain medicine.
2. 64% revenue growth over the first quarter of 2020 was reported earlier this year, but the stock go caught up in the massive sell off for all high risk tech stocks. The stock peaked at over $200 earlier this year, and now being at \~140 provides a chance for some great short term upside. As we are seeing in today's market, when confidence comes back to the market the big caps are first to benefit, followed by the small/mid caps. TWST is perfectly positioned for this next small/mid cap move.
3. Longer term, the stock is even more exciting. They are working with Microsoft (and Illumina (ILMN)) as the founding members of a working group to define the future of data storage using DNA. Give it 10 years, and we will be seeing this method used for data storage. And long before then, once the first signs of progress are seen the hype will be too much for stocks to handle. That last part could happen far before anyone can predict...

There are loads of other reasons this company provides the lowest risk high risk investment you will ever find, but I won't bore you. Do some of your own DD and remember this isn't financial advice. Really, I know nothing.

They also have a great website with some great colour schemes.
