SRN G/DNA as of tomorrow has been a tough one to move. That is all changing this week.

There were 180 million in the OS as the spac SRN G. %50 was redeemed leaving 87 million. Now subtract the 20 million that ARK owns and IS NOT SELLING as ARK is a large part invested in the PIPE and you are down to 65 million. Now subtract the 10 million that CDEL owns. 55 million. Now take away %50 of that that people who are in for the long haul are not selling. You are down to perhaps only 25 million in the float. 

Think about it...Ark and cathie own almost %50 of the tradeable float. It is unreal.

Guys, spac redemption are on fire, and this one could be the cream of the crop. Because with this one people actually want to own it! Cathie is in this huge...will be her next TSLA. She has this float on LockDown.
