So, friend, this past week you made the plunge and decided to join the **Men of the Clov Bag Watch**. We'll ol' Cbass is here to welcome you to this *definitely-not-a-cult* group of investors who are, throughout the internet, highly **R**egarded for **E**xcellence, **T**houghtfulness, **A**droitness and **R**espectably **D**istinguished **E**loquence in **D**iscourse (*occasionally* going by the acronym: **RETARDED**).

**Part 1. Technically Anal**

So this past week saw a considerable breakout of the $9 resistance wall and a concomitant FOMOing into the ticker with FD's destined to Lambo or Burn. Well those FDs are either now ash or in a giant gasoline-soaked pyre, but let's have a look at the charts to see if any of the poor bastards holding 9/17 $17 calls can be saved.

First, a general look at the important lines:

[So many lines, so much value](https://preview.redd.it/cnrsj3ehy2n71.png?width=1576&format=png&auto=webp&s=c95d5beb400d7024a6196736106457fd6c843879)

The most important level on here is the one I've labeled "Launch #1", though at this point the "#1" is looking smidgen unnecessary. First established on the gap-down on Oct. 6 of last year, it provided resistance on three occasions afterward (yellow arrows for the simpletons), with the last ending in a massive breakout to all-time highs.

The $9.08 line is the second most important line on the chart, in my possibly chromosome-deficient opinion. First established on Mar. 15 of this year after the bounce from all-time lows, it provided some level of resistance immediately afterward, but in the post *squeeze-that-wasn't-a-squeeze* world of the past few months it has become the ultimate resistance, a titanic, 700-foot wall of ice and sorrow towering over the pitiable bag holders huddling beneath its monstrously cold heights. Before this week, there were three prior attempts so surmount the Wall, all ending failure.

Of next and most immediate importance is the $8 mark. I have it as $7.94 as there is a small case for its origin story beginning on Mar. 25 of this year. However, like the $9 mark, its true importance has been found recently, and ***cannot be overstated***: This line, however pitiful, represents a **higher low** and thus holding that line is of critical importance for the prospects of any near-term upward action.

The orange downtrend line was the last of the downtrend lines, and crossing it resulted in the most recent attempt at the Wall of $9.

The green line is **the bottom**, a place of green pastures and buxom women, where the burdens of your bags will vanish away . . . because you've passed from this world and its worries.

&#x200B;

Next is a chart looking at the $11.13 mark:

[Fibonacci, because Italian people](https://preview.redd.it/86tdxc76z2n71.png?width=1576&format=png&auto=webp&s=05b1f1e37ef85a53788c7100bddb17f9d64889a2)

As shown, the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level of $11.13 is shaping up to be a very important line. Indeed, it is soon to over shadow the $11.80 breakout line in that regard. On the dump following the June push, the ticker found support at $11.16 on Jun. 21, and subsequently it opened and dumped down from that level on a Jul. 6 (yellow arrows for simpletons). And just this week we saw the ticker reach up to **exactly** $11.13, before getting summarily thrown back off the top of the Wall. At this point, I think a breakout of $11.13 probably results in a significant push up. But we're getting well ahead of ourselves with that.

&#x200B;

Being a TA wunderkind, I've turned my head to just the right angle and found a sliver of hope for the hopeless Men of the Watch:

[Two girls & a cup: can't possibly fail](https://preview.redd.it/ary603egz2n71.png?width=1842&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4e5b5f27b60656be73760dee5251e0e1d79e6b8)

The good news is it looks like a cup & handle formation. The bad news is that *usually* a cup & handle is a pause in an uptrend. Here, however, you have a downtrend into the cup (the giant pink arrow for the simpletons). This is a great example of Cbass's First Law of TA: You can always find a chart & indicator combination to tell you what you want to hear. So, let's just call this a positive, because we have little else.

&#x200B;

Looking at 1hr chart, let's see if we can find some more copium:

[I see Higher Lows from my house!](https://preview.redd.it/dyaiz8hnz2n71.png?width=1842&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f6ec421727eeedc62a68c18d33c86a25cd03e9d)

After the post earnings dump, CLOV briefly had a breakdown below the $8 support before rallying back up to test the $9 Wall, repeatedly. In that time, it found itself in a new channel between $8.40 and $8.60, thus establishing $8.40 as a **new, higher low**. This, as much as the Great YOLO Brigade of Labor Day Weekend, was the cause of the breakout on Tuesday. Basically, the chart was screaming that a breakout was incoming, YOLO brigade be damned.

The copium for next week is whether or not another higher low can be put in at $8.60. Like any good Man of the Bag Watch I have to hope it can, because if I try to leave, my portfolio gets hunted down and beheaded.

The worse and therefore more likely scenario is a breakdown all the way back to $8, undoing several weeks worth of upward progress. The absolute worst case is a *true* failure of $8 and a return to all-time lows. This would be a dagger in the heart, and unless someone knows a Red Woman, we're fucked.

[Winning, winning so fuckin' hard right now](https://preview.redd.it/8zf0arxvz2n71.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=55ff09023716e9894e0f4fd672ec56fa1d4808de)

**Part 2. Dynamically-expanding Dildos** (^(for maximum gapping))

In true Clovtard fashion, my knowledge of this company prior to purchasing shares was "it does some techy stuff with healthcare." Which, it turns out, is basically all you need to know. This company is one of those that seems complex and super high-tech, but in reality is more basic bitch than your average Instagram thot. That being said, it might still work out for them... after all, do you see some of these basic bitches that blow up on Instagram? Living proof that ***literally anything*** is possible.

But just in case someone cares (and to keep the Clovtards from reeing in the comments), here's a look at the company underlying the CLOV:

&#x200B;

\----------------------------

***Business Model***

* **TL;DR: they sell insurance to old people & process payment claims from doctors**

Clover sell two products:

1. Medicare Advantage (MA) plans, which are just insurance plans for people on Medicare that include extra services along with the Medicare stuff, and
2. Direct Contracting (DC) plans, which are one of several alternative payment models recently put forth by CMS (the people that run Medicare)

The important difference between these is that Medicare Advantage is an insurance plan where the ***patient*** is Clover's customer and Direct Contracting is where the ***doctor*** is Clover's customer. With the latter, Clover is acting as, essentially, a *payment processor* for the doctor's Medicare patients. This allows Clover to get a sweet slice of that government largess. On the doctors' side of it, they deal with Clover instead of CMS. Supposedly the whole scheme (and this is one of five put forth by CMS in 2020) is supposed to save the government money (>!it won't!<). I don't give a fuck about that part; all I care about here is whether Clover can grow their slice of the pie.

This Direct Contracting scheme was a ***major selling point*** for Chamath when they went public (more on that below), and for good reason. Clover only needs to manage a single relationship (with the doctor) to grab up dozens, or potentially hundreds, of patients. This DC scheme should be (*on paper at least)* far more efficient than Clover's original business model, which was just managing MA plans.

&#x200B;

\----------------------------

***Growth***

* **TL;DR: they can** ***potentially*** \~**25x their customer base** (^(but probably much, much less))

So other than **"the squeeze"**, why would anyone ***genuinely*** believe this company is going to have some astronomical valuation that would give them a stock price on par with the likes of United Healthcare? Simple: growth.

Right now Clover only services MA and DC contracts in a small number of counties: 108 in 8 states. They are expected to nearly double with an additional 101 counties by the end of the year, bringing the total to 209 in 9 states. Since there are 3,000 some odd counties in the United States, there is (*on paper*) a lot of room to expand here. **This is good**.

As of their latest earnings report, they had 128,591 "lives under management." (I think that is a creepy as fuck way of putting it, but I *guess* it's industry standard....) Of those, 66,566 were MA customers and the remaining 62,025 were *indirect* patients, i.e., the Medicare patients of doctors in a DC agreement with Clover. The total of \~129,000 was a year-over-year increase of 126.3%. **This is also good**.

&#x200B;

* **Math time!**

In their best counties, Clover has upward of 25% market share (at least this is their *claim*); that is, they have a quarter of the MA patients signed up with them. But to assume they can do that everywhere would be absurd. To keep this ultra simple, let's just assume that their current percentage as of the last earnings report is representative of what they can do. So that is 128,591 "lives" across 108 counties which comes to an **average of 1,190 "lives" per county**.  (Obviously, not all counties are the same size, but let's just use this average for simplicity's sake.) So we have:

**1,190 x 3000 = 3.57 million "lives"**

**3,570,000 / 128,591 = 27.8**

So, ***theoretically***, Clover could achieve **27.8x growth** in customers, and ***presumably*** a similar growth in revenue. (We'll get to profitability, or lack there of, below.) Looking deeper at this number, one thing going for it is that the number of old people is steadily increasing. But on the other hand, competition is a thing, and big thing in this space. To assume that Clover is going to have 3.5 million customers in 10 years, or even 20, is pretty wild.....

Chamath claimed Clover was the "easiest ten bagger" he'd ever seen (or some shit like that). So, even going with that number, they would end up with 1.3 million "lives" in ten years. Even this seems pretty high to me. They went from 0 to 62,025 DC patients this year, but it is ***always easier to grow when you're small***. Scaling is an issue for all businesses.

&#x200B;

\----------------------------

***Profitability***

* **TL;DR: they'll make no profit for a long ass time** (^(if ever))

As for actually making money, well Clover doesn't do that. Yes, they had a 140% increase in revenue, which is good, but their expenses are rising ***faster*** than revenue. Accordingly, they missed on earnings by -0.52, or **378% downside surprise**. In typical corporate fashion, their forward guidance is full of claims of improvement on cost management just around the corner.

There is, to be fair here, a legitimate reason for some of the cost increases in the form of covid expenses. Essentially, some old people needed extra care, while others *delayed* care until it looked safe which caused a massive spike in trips to the doctor. And when you're old and you let shit slide, it gets a lot worse and a lot more expensive.

Furthermore, their basic strategy involves eating losses when they take on new "lives under management," with the idea that they'll make it back, and more, further down the road with that same patient though the efficiencies of their "A.I.", Clover Assistant.

Taking them at their word that this works (and will continue to do so at larger scales) then it is obvious they will being eating losses for years to come. Allegedly, they'll turn a profit in 2023, but I wouldn't hold my breath on that. However, just growing their "lives under management" number might be enough to hold up the stock price.

It might **not** be enough, however, to keep the lights on. If they can't at least slow the bleeding, share issuances could be lurking down the road (queue the pump & dump conspiracies).

&#x200B;

\----------------------------

***Competition***

* **TL;DR: they have to take market share from better companies**

As noted above, the biggest hurdle in front of Clover is **competition**. Despite the "tech start-up" narrative surrounding Clover, the reality is that they are marching into the teeth of well-entrenched healthcare companies.

The likes of United Healthcare and Humana aren't going to take lightly to little ol' Clov rolling up in their shit. With about 10 million patients between them, UH and Humana are monsters in the Medicare space and with that comes the ability to undercut the competition. Furthermore, all these big players also have their own ***magic AI machine-learning gizmos*** that do ***magic AI things***. And they already have access to more data than Clover on account of their massive patient base.

This doesn't mean they can just snuff Clover out of existence, but taking away market share from established players is a far different gambit than expanding into a new market. And it gets harder the bigger you get.

&#x200B;

\----------------------------

***Shaddy Shit***

* **TL;DR: Chamath is a shaddy af, and so is the CEO**

This whole shabang was rolled out in typical Chamath fashion. Back in October of 2020, in his pitch for Clover, he claimed they **"already"** had 200,000 lives under management in their **Direct Contracting program** (i.e., not including the MA patients). Except that was bullshit of the Chamath-degree. At the time he claimed this, Clover ***hadn't even started*** its DC program (it had only just been accepted into the program).

As their latest earning report notes, they don't expect to get anymore "lives" in their DC program until Jan. 2022. (This is due to Medicare enrollment period rules). So, rather than "already" having 200,000 for 2021, Clover will instead end the year with the \~62,000 that they have right now. ***Chamath at his finest, ladies and gentlemen.***

Clover's top guy, Vivek, is also well-known for being shaddy. Though, in his case, I don't actually care as much. Back in the day, this guy ran three hospitals in NJ that were noteworthy for having the highest fees of any hospitals in America. Shaddy, but shaddy in the ***ruthless capitalism direction***. He gets a pass from Cbass *for this*. He is also alleged to have pilfered a company he ran back in the day. This doesn't get a pass, because it could negatively affect my bottom line.

Clover is the subject of two ***related*** investigations, one from DoJ and the other from the SEC. The DoJ one is about shaddy business practices; something about kickbacks. I also don't give much of a fuck about this. The SEC investigation is about the fact that the DoJ investigation was not disclosed during the SPAC merger. All this will probably amount to some fines, if anything at all.

On scale of 0 to Enron, I'll give Clover a 1.5. Doesn't look that bad to me.

&#x200B;

\----------------------------

***Technology***

* **TL;DR: they have a magic AI app that's designed to maximize** **~~health~~** ***profits*** (^(maybe))

The last thing to mention is the Great Green Hope: the **Clover Assistant**. This is the "tech" in Clover and the reason dipshits are using #TelsaHealth. What is it? Well, basically a data input and analysis program. More basically: *Microsoft Excel with fancy buttons*.

Clover Assistant is used by the doctors (and many MA patients use it, too) to coordinate and recommend stuff. The Great Hope here is that doctors love using this thing so much that they'll sign onto a DC agreement with Clover, allowing Clover to process their Medicare payment claims in exchange for access to the "**app**".

So is it going to work? Well, it is ***starting*** to: Clover went from 0 to 62,000 patients via this scheme this year. It's a country fucking mile from what Chamath claimed, but ain't nothing. And given the potential for expansion into the rest of the US, and you have the receipt for a pretty damn good return on capital. But then again, it is just an "app".

To be clear, I don't hate the *idea* of Clover Assistant. Conceptually, I actually like it. The Clover Assistant basically helps doctors make sure their patients are getting the "right care" by compiling data and presenting it in an easy to use fashion. This is presented as an opportunity to "improve outcomes" and "save costs" and "help the under-served." But I don't give a rat's ass about any of that.

Which brings me to the Hindenburg report, and the part about it that I ***like***. The report claims that Clover is using the Assistant to direct doctors toward medical recommendations that would result in profits for Clover (rather than the best medical outcome), and that they are incentivizing the doctors with increased payments for these outcomes. ***I love this.*** Now, Clover vehemently denies this is the case, but I (not so) secretly hope they're lying here, because this is ***exactly*** what I imagine when I think of applying Big Data-A.I. and Machine Learning to healthcare.

People have ***blind faith*** in machines, particularly ones that they've been told are "**A.I. powered**" and involve "**machine learning**". Thus, you can use the concept of "A.I." to persuade patients to just accept whatever the computer tells them. Machine learning is then used program the Clover Assistant to ***maximize profits***, which should involve providing the minimum care required to keep the patient alive as long as possible. (Medicare pays a set amount to Clover and they get to keep the extra if the patients don't use up all the funds).

The only way I could see to improve on this diabolical scheme would be if they ground up the corpses of their newly deceased patients, turned them into food and fed them to the rest of their **"lives under management."** I'm lookin' for every penny here, kids, ***every single penny***.

**Part 3. A Conspiracy of Idiocy**

Typical of any stock ticker that gathers a cultish following, the Clovidiots are as well-known for their conspiracy theories as they are for their options expiring worthless. Now, most of these are the run-of-mill shit you get with any ticker: the Hedgies, reeee! You would think that this is the first time some of these people had ever bought a stock... oh, wait.

&#x200B;

\----------------------------

***Hedgies!!!***

* **TL;DR: it's the stock market, deal with it**

So, do the "Hedge Funds" manipulate the stock price? Well, sure, why not. They definitely shorted it, and then managed to cover those short sales with little appreciable rise in the stock. Back in June, CLOV was at something like a 48% shorted. Now the it's 15% and I believe it got as low as 7% before this week's run up. While going from 48% to 7% short with no appreciable rise in the stock price looks impossible, it's definitely not when you considered that a large percentage of the float has been in institutional hands this whole time. Stock goes up a little, they sell and back down she goes, welcome to a regular day on the stock market.

Is this some grand conspiracy of fat cats in a room smoking cigars as they plan out how to stick it to those pesky Reddit kids? ***I doubt it***, but if it makes you feel better, whatever.

I, personally, would worry less about the "Hedge Funds" and more about the Market Makers, as they're the ones selling you the options, and if they buy up the stock beforehand, they can sell out for a profit while simultaneous vaporizing those call options you bought from them. In fact, I'm pretty sure this is the game.

Can anything be done about it? Well, no, not really. At least, not unless retail buys up a larger percentage of the float. However, with each false run up, I wonder if that exact process is taking place, i.e., more bagholders are being newly minted, and each, not wanting to take an L and just move on with his life, decides to become a "diamond handed ape." Only time will reveal the truth of this.

&#x200B;

\----------------------------

***Us vs. the World***

* **TL;DR: everyone thinks this way, deal with it**

The second great conspiracy of CLOV is that the whole of the internet is out to get it. This is proffered with the full knowledge that GME-Anon and Popcorn ***both believe the same thing about their own stock.*** Both also believe that CLOV is, ***in and of itself***, a conspiracy to distract from their pet stock. But GME-Anon ***also believes*** that Popcorn is an engineered distraction. And all three are ***also*** convinced that the Mods are out to get them, ***specifically***.

This is, of course, perfectly normal behavior. That might seem shocking to some of you, but the next time you're watching football with a die hard fan (or whatever lame-ass europoor sport you watch), look for their reactions whenever the slightest thing doesn't go their way:

* *"These fucking refs are terrible! They're totally biased against my team! They've got it out for us! I'm going to write an angry letter to the league!"*

Sound familiar? It should, because if you look around with open eyes, you'll find this exact behavioral pattern repeated at infinitum across every conceivable human endeavor.

Do people hate CLOV and the masses of idiots holding it? Sure, and I don't blame them. You guys can be pretty fucking annoying. That does not, however, equate to a grand conspiracy of suppression. The fact that your copy-pasta DD got nixed just like everyone else's lazy dogshit copy-pasta is not you being singled out. It's you not understanding the rules and adapting your behavior to play within them. But hey, maybe it's easier to just blame the Mods.

**Part 4. Rise now, a Man of the Bag Watch**

Having taken a brief tour of Castle Black and had a bit of a feel for what it's like to be a venerable Man of the Clov Bag Watch, most of you are probably thinking: *Okay, how the fuck do I get out this chickenshit operation?*

Well, you are probably still hoping for **moon**. In that regard, I've some bad news for you: ***there will be no squeeze.***

There will absolutely not be a **short squeeze**. At 15% short, there is zero chance of this happening. *"But, bruh, the* ***real*** *short number is like 420% bruh."* Bullshit. Just straight bullshit.

There is also not going to be a **gamma squeeze.** Not anytime soon, and likely never. In order to get a gamma squeeze you need options that are going to be delta-hedged. But why delta-hedge options that are going to be Thanos-snapped out of existence by expiry?

A while back, it looked like there could be a **mixed squeeze** (short covering + gamma hedging), but that's all in the past now. Down the road from now, could it still happen? Yeah, sure, and I could end up raw-dogging a Victoria's Secret model on the hood of my new lambo. All kinds of crazy things are ***possible***, but that doesn't make them ***likely***.

And honestly, what the fuck is wrong with a good ol' grind up? Squeezes are fun, I get it. You get to see your money double, triple, 5x, 10x, all in the space of a day or two. You get to see those option YOLO's gain a thousand of percent in minutes. But you still make money on a grind up. A fuckload of it.

I'm not sure I buy into this whole notion of a "squeeze" being the **Holy Grail of the Stock Market**. It's starting to sound like the Bears and their perpetual claims that they're going to make ***all the money*** on the coming collapse, all while lighting round after round of SPY puts on fire. The Squeeze Fanatics are doing the same thing, but with call options on meme stocks.

But, hey, what do I know? I'm just peon in this operation, a pitifully small cog in the great meat grinder we call the stock market. For now the chart tells me there's still **hope of up**, and so my bag watch continues. When the chart dies and there is no more good to be said of the company, then I will initiate my Bagholder Optimization Formula and there my watch will end. Until then, I man my post.
