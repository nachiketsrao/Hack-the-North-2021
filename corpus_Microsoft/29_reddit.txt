Many things in this world require semi conductors! Its only a thriving technological world. I am a salesperson at a Large FCA Store (Stellantis) Dealership in the midwest, and we are sitting on less vehicles today for sale in September, 2021 than we had in July, 2021.

With rising demand in Electronics TSMC says has begun construction at its Arizona chip factory site. **June 1** (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (2330.TW) (TSMC) has started construction at a site in Arizona where it plans to spend $12 billion to build a computer chip factory, its chief executive said on Tuesday.

I think we may see a rise in Semi Conductors in the years to come. Everything that requires a button in your car, fire stick remote controller, xbox controller, keyboard etc... requires a semi conductor.

The problem with the vehicle shortage is that the vehicle manufactures planned to schedule less chips in February 2021 for the vehicles of 2021 sales. They thought they would sell less vehicles this year because of the Covid, however, earlier this year, things opened and mask came off.  The car manufactures decided to instead order the same amount of chips as they usually do yearly, but the orders were already booked for other manufactures that needed chips. This is why you dont see a shortage in Smart phones, and computers, or TVS. The chip factories are producing chips for them first now before they can produce for car manufactures. It isn't because of a covid factory shut down...

This gives me reason to believe that demand will only increase for Semi Conductors and since TSM holds the most market in this area and they can generally control pricing.

This shows that the demand of current electrical devices int he world is actually far greater than we expected!

Today i bought 100 calls, (2 days after earnings) purchase and am expecting more long term purchased investments into this company. I expect better than expected earnings, because last week, a representative said that we can expect order tightness of conductors to follow into next year.

IF you look at the earnings chart, each quarter they have gone closer to matching expected earnings, and this next earnings should either be the same or better than expected.
