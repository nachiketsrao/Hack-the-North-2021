What is up with this run up?

Its literally just Gamestop agreeing to use Microsofts OneDrive and their software how will this increase sales???


This run up wont last and GME will fall back down to under $10

Its like Costco running up because they agreed to use Microsoft office for 3 years doesnt make any sense
