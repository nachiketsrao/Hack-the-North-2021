After falling out of a two month uptrending channel, MSFT is struggling to get back over support.  
On RSI, it was overbought sitting around 75.00 in need of a pullback.  
MSFT also continues to fight against the bullish market as of now.

Not only do we have those two things going for us, we are also forming a perfect head and shoulders pattern.  


Holding MSFT 275 put 7/30 @ 2.74 avg  
First target (at the neckline): 275.45  
Second target (via volume profile): 270.50
