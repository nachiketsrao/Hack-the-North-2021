I'm going to keep this short, most here probably have already heard of $MVIS (microvision), their IP is around laser beam scanning technology, used in near eye displays (NED) such as Microsoft Hololens 2, and now their primary focus is automotive lidar.

The bad, company has been around for 20 some years and poor revenue each year making most call it an overvalued shit stock, but I figure if the DOD is paying Microsoft $20bn for a military version of the Hololens (IVAS) then their tech must be good, which should translate over to their automotive lidar. If you then compare their market cap vs other speculative lidar companies market caps then they start to seem undervalued, having the NED technology is just an added bonus.

Anyhow this post was less of a DD as others have gone to much greater extents explaining the value of this company and their tech, my main reason posting is to share my bet in the open then come mid Sept we can all see it play out for better or for worse.

Oh almost forgot, MVIS will be at a mobility conference in Germany Sept 7-12 where they'll publicly demo their lidar units for the first time, claiming best in class, addressing SWAP-C and OEM / Tier 1 needs.

Oh one more, MVIS couldn't acknowledge MSFT as being their customer until the last EC when it was announced due to NDA. Why the sudden change? Well if the NED vertical was in the process of being sold off to MSFT then trying to hide it doesn't really matter anymore. Drew Markham joined MVIS 3 months ago as general counsel with decades of M&A experience. I expect the vertical sold and nice one time dividend coming within the next 3-6 months.
