“One enemy all leaders must keep in check is inflation. If the people can’t afford, or they can’t find what they want, they revolt. The path to many a guillotine has been paved by empty market stalls.”

Edit: I own puts on Microsoft and Apple. So take my words with a grain of salt. Think for yourselves and never take anyone on their word, specially me

Edit2: If the reaction to this is as it should be, it could be ugly. Watch your fucking selves and set stop limits, trail stops all that. If im wrong then whatever it wont get hit. Just keep an eye out on that cpi report Tuesday. Dont get rugged and trade defensively. 

Like always its 50/50 but now x10 as markets are on edge. Dont listen to bulls or bears, listen to your pockets and stay loyal to them.

Good luck
