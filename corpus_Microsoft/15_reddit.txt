Read first, thank me later. **AvePoint (ticker: AVPT), the Largest Microsoft 365 Data Management Solutions Provider was just listed publicly on Nasdaq last week.**

**// About AvePoint**

AvePoint is the largest data management solutions provider for the Microsoft cloud, with over 1,300 employees in 29 global offices. Key takeaway:

* AvePoint was founded in 2001 as a company to help ease the complexity of SharePoint installations, which at the time were all on-premise. Today, it has adapted to the shift to the cloud as a SaaS tool and primarily acts as a policy layer enabling companies to make sure employees are using these tools in a compliant way

**// TL;DR - Bottom line**

* AvePoint is a Market leading SaaS company, with powerful tailwinds for Microsoft Cloud, a high quality and diversified customer base and compelling historical & expected financial results, business model and valuation
* Compared to competitors like JAMF, FASTLY, CLOUDFLARE, etc AVPT is trading at 2-3X discount based on earnings to market cap valuation. Avepoint's earnings are coming up in August which should be followed by price targets from key analysts that will push the price up to tendy land!

UPDATE 7/17/21: [Evercore ISI covers AVPT PT at $15](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/evercore-initiates-coverage-on-avepoint-with-outperform-rating-sees-53-upside-1030615884)  
Upcoming Catalysts:   
\- 5+ analysts are expected to cover AVPT (PTs). Some names include Goldman Sachs, Citi, etc as AVPT co-founder has already had communication with these institutions prior to choosing to go the SPAC route so they already have a relationship.   
\- ER (Earnings report) will be coming out early August and I'm expecting AVPT to beat the estimates as they have been each quarter. 

This company is under the radar of many institutions but we should see a much larger adoption of tutes coming up over the next few months. GL my fellow autists!
