 I keep calling Microsoft but I don’t seem to get any money. What am I doing wrong? I mean Microsoft 150 call should work right. But they keep saying sir stop calling us we can’t help you. Even my puts don’t work, I put down the phone nothing happens. What do I do? Is there something wrong with Microsoft? Do I need to call other companies? Why is buying a share so easy to do over the internet but a call has to be using a phone? I mean come on its 2020.
