Since the conversion to $AVPT (7/1) this will be the first quarter that Avepoint announces it’s financial results as a publicly traded company. On Tuesday 8/10 after market close Avepoint will report earnings. 

Avepoint is the largest provider of Microsoft 365 data management solutions… considering Microsoft just CRUSHED their earnings (20% YOY revenue growth, 46% YOY net income growth) one would think Avepoint may follow in Microsoft’s shadow. Especially considering the fact that Microsoft cloud fueled much of the growth Microsoft had. 

Office 365 commercial growth revenue was 25% YOY in it of itself. Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers increased to 51.9 million. Avepoint is the only Microsoft partner to provide these data management solutions to Microsoft’s new customers. One would infer that this sets a very strong stage for success for Avepoint.

In addition 5 banks/brokerages have initated coverage on AVPT this past month and the average of their price targets comes in at $14.29, with high end estimates at $17. AVPT is currently trading at $10.29. 

This seems like the perfect tendie set up. Thoughts?
