This is the options chain for the calls expiring this week.  3200 was clearly a significant number, and AMZN closed at 3199.95.  That's fucking hilarious.  Someone clearly wanted it below that number.

The daily chart makes it pretty obvious that it's bottomed out.   3180 has been a crucial level many times in the past.  This level is also the point of control, which is where most of the volume has occurred in recent history.  These high volume areas are institutional buying.

We probably should have corrected more this week, at least to the 50 day moving average for SPY.  That would've been healthy, and it seemed like it tried to every day.  If you made money this week, well done, because I definitely got trapped.  Microsoft just kept popping, along with the rest of big tech except for AMZN.  The fact that every dip was bought up like nothing(especially Monday, what the fuck was that shit) means were probably going higher.  But big tech, the linchpin of the financial world right now, is stretched pretty thin with the exception of AMZN.  I think MSFT cools off next week, and AMZN pumps to keep us painfully churning here.

Position: 8/27 3215c

Edit:  forgot to add the unusual call buying today for next week at the 3200 strike.

I'll gladly take a 30 day ban if I'm wrong, but I want a flair if I'm right.   Also, I'm not saying its going to run back to all time highs.  I'm saying it'll bounce from the selling pressure being exhausted for the time being.  Looking for a bounce to 3350 in the short term.  After that, no clue.  It'll probably continue its downtrend.
