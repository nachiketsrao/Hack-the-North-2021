I believe Microvision is ripe for a buyout. All factors aside, I was to speak on two reasons. Drew Markham and Microvision’s intellectual property (IP).

MVIS hired Drew Markham as General Counsel in late June 2021. Who is Drew Markham? 

Drew Markham has more than 20 years of experience advising publicly traded technology companies in corporate governance, M&A and capital markets transactions, having served in both external and in-house counsel roles.

She worked for Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati for 14 years (1999-2012).

According to Wilson Sonsini's website they facilitated countless landmark deals some of which include:

-Google's $3.1bn acquisition of Double Click (2007),
-Roche's $48bn acquisition of Genetech (2009)
-Oracle's $7.8bn acquisition of Sun Microsystems (2009)
-HP's $3.3bn acquisition of 3Coms (2009)
-Intel's $7.7bn acquisition of McAfee (2010)
-Total's $1.5bn acquisition of SunPower. (2011)

All these deals happened when Drew Markham was Special Council for Wilson Sonsini. 

The most valuable asset Microvision has - and the one that potential buyers looking to acquire or enter into strategic partnerships with Microvision are interested in is Microvision’s vast IP portfolio. MVIS has over 450 patents with 20+ pending.

The fact that Drew Markham has very little hands on experience in the world of patents and IP matters - but does have hands on experience in M&A and strategic partnerships and alliances tells me one thing

If there are indeed companies interested in acquiring Microvision or establishing a strategic relationship with Microvision- they have already done a deep dive analysis and review of the IP and are now involved in the nitty gritty of working out the legal and logistical details of a deal

Microvision does not need a general counsel with experience to protect their most valuable asset (IP). They now need someone versed in nitty gritty of M&A and Strategic partnerships & alliances.

Drew Markham is that someone. Per her LinkedIn she worked for companies (edit: such as E&Y and Wilson Sonsini) from 1989-2016. All reputable firms, which most likely paid her more than generously.

From 2017-2021, she was self employees/ retired? Why would she come out of retirement in 2021 to work for Microvision?

The only thing I can think of is she is working on the deal of her career.

TLDR: Drew Markham = M&A or Buyout
