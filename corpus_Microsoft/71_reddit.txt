This is the most stupid saga I have ever been a part of. Tired of the merry go round between MSFT, WMT, ORCL, FB, TWTR and SNAP calls. Each time there is some development, China cockblocks these at will. MSFT would be much better without buying TikTok and all the baggage that comes with it.  
  
What are your thoughts on this long running TikTok play. It's been 2 months and even puts the other gang I've been a part of (clang gang) to shame.
