Just got a text from a “non-autist” complaining about the new Xbox drop. Apparently in their most recent drop the only options were bundles costing from 6-700 dollars and it comes with a 25 dollar GME gift card, game pass ultimate, and some other stuff like an extra controller that I don’t give two shits about.

All I know it’s PROFITS PROFITS PROFITS for GME

Positions: GME $22 2/19, GME $30 4/16, GME $ 35 4/16, and GME $ 35 7/16 in case DA BEARS see us all buying April calls and pull some illegal bullshit which of course they won’t get in trouble for.
