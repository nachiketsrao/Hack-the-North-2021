There is something strange here. One missing piece of the puzzle. The company (GME) didn't talk at all on what happened in the stock market. Although large majority of [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) apes are gamers, the company preferred to stay silent. I would like to talk about it also here. (Edit: I thought it was well know, [Microsoft Official Partnership with GameStop from the official website](https://news.microsoft.com/2020/10/08/gamestop-announces-multiyear-strategic-partnership-with-microsoft/))

# GameStop didn't say a word about the stock market events, why? Can it be a very tight contract for a future acquisition by Microsoft?

**Their silence** is the main point here. **Why they didn't talk?** They were in the simple position to make a simple interview that was going be seen by all the world in stick and say: "*we are looking forward to innovate. We can adapt our business bla bla new technologies and bla bla new directors*". That's it, and that's obvious. What kind of company is not going to believe something like that?

Why in the hell GME didn't talk at all? they were surely able to say something vague and rhetorical in case they didn't really want to support us. They were also surely contacted by the press, and invited in some cool TV show. **It was their choice. They actively chose to not talk**. Maybe they thought that this is a bubble and they didn't want to make it bigger, still they were totally able to say bla bla innovation bla bla Cohen bla bla future. Or they were preparing some financial report and they were obligate by some boomer law to not talk at all. Or, maybe, they have a contract, an agreement with some other more powerful entity that is forbidding GME to talk on certain topics / under certain circumstances.

Let's imagine the last one. **Let's imagine that** **GME cannot talk due to some contract boundaries**. Contract whit whom? I would say **Microsoft**. Microsoft is powerful, big, rich, and they are partners already. Better: **strategic partners**. *What if this partnership is the first step for an acquisition?*

I know, anti-trust regulations can have something to say about it

That is what I see:

* **Blackrock** (I love Blackrock, high growth + 2% dividends annualized? lovely), **Michael Burry** (yeah, the guy of The Big Short), and [u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/), all of them purchased a big chunk of GME. Why? did some of them hear some interesting rumour? Did they smell something that we didn't smell?
* New CEO. **Ryan Cohen** join the board to innovate the business completely. Why? someone else suggested this? He wanted to do it by himself? Press is pushing the narrative that Cohen put one foot out of his bed one morning and said: "*I wanna be the CEO of GameStop*". Randomly?
* Strategic **Partnership with Microsoft**. I don't know which one comes first, if this or Cohen, I guess some ape can check meticulously. You know how does it sound to me? It sounds like the first step to do an acquisition. Among all the solutions Microsoft chose to partener with GameStop. Ok. And if the partnership goes very well, what will happen? they will keep staying just partners?
* The value of GME shares just skyrocketed and **GameStop didn't say anything about it.** With no reason? They decided to not support the internet riot made basically by gamers or people in target (age / income / demography / interests / lifestyle). From a Marketing perspective doesn't sound right to me. Press, journalists, social media, TVs they wanted a comment from GameStop. Everybody was screaming for the official point of view from the company, and GameStop decided to stay silent. *Usually companies pay good money to go on TV*, this time it was going to be free advertising. So why they refused free advertising (free money)? For one good reason surely. What reason can it be? Must be a good one. A contract maybe? Yeah, it can be. And with whom? a contract with a big one. A big one like Microsoft? Maybe.
* The **average gamer** is getting older, and richer. Every guy born in the late 80s now has a job (should have one I hope). Good customer base, growing in numbers, growing in income, cannot go down = secure income for a company. ***How would you get them all (all gamers in the world) if you were Microsoft?*** Acquisition. The acquisition of a gaming company I would say can be one of the easiest, safest, fastest way available to get a big piece of this customer segment (gamers).

Am I right? am I wrong? Only time will tell us
