Last week I gave you all my genius plan to reach [$1 Billion in 16 months](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pl4i1v/i_developed_an_options_strategy_that_will_make_me/)  and how I am [shorting China to save the world](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pipoka/labor_day_trade_im_going_to_short_china_and_save/). Today, you will enjoy the greatness and see why $YANG is still the best risk:reward trade in the universe.

# Hwanging for $YANG (leveraged gains on gains)

$YANG is a beautiful ETF that is 3x the inverse of China. Like the great Bill Hwang, I have learned a lot about leverage and how to properly use it to amplify my returns. Just a direct China inverse ETF is boring. For me to become rich, I need to add leverage, and $YANG is the perfect ETF for that goal. On top of that, I will be buying YANG 65 calls for January, the furthest OTM calls available. YANG 65 calls can create a gamma squeeze in the event China has a total and rapid collapse.

Chinese stocks have been declining this entire year, and still have a long way to go. Cathie üò∞ has sold her China stocks, mentioning that she is done dealing with Xi‚Äòs rugpulls and navigating the uncertainties of the CCP. The CCP makes China common stocks look like options.

# Evergrande

Evergrande is China‚Äôs 2nd best real estate developer. They currently have over $350 billion in liabilities, which they are quickly defaulting on. Like many Chinese real estate companies, Evergrande has built many ghost cities. These cities cost billions of dollars and lie uninhabited, ultimately being destroyed or collapsing on their own. These cities do not provide any recurring economic value, and waste money, time, and materials.

# Evergrande bonds are like SPY 0 DTE puts

Just like how SPY 0 DTE puts always go to $0 because SPY only goes up, buying Evergrande bonds is nearly identical. Many of Evergrande‚Äôs face value bonds have declined 60-80%, with yields rising from 9.5% to over 1,100%. As Evergrande defaults on bonds, investors lose billions of dollars. This will trickle to other companies as there will be less capital to invest elsewhere.

# If Evergrande collapses, it will take China‚Äôs real estate market with it

Evergrande is the second best real estate developer in China. #2! This is like Microsoft saying they are filing for bankruptcy. Real Estate makes up over 30% of China‚Äôs GDP. Many people invest their entire life savings, parents money, and borrowed money into their home. If real estate collapses, the rest of China‚Äôs consumption will go down with it. Evergrande poses massive systemic risk to China‚Äôs economy. This is a massive domino effect that will cause a decline. Lending will be restricted, further slowing growth as China‚Äôs growth is fueled by debt, not consumption, which is not a sustainable path forward. When China stops allowing new debt to be issued, growth will decline rapidly and be unstoppable.

# China‚Äôs Economy is slowing or declining

If you trust the CCP‚Äôs numbers, then Chinas economy is slowing. If you don‚Äôt trust the CCP numbers, then China‚Äôs economy is declining. Retail sales were expected to grow 7%, instead they only grew 2.5%.   This is a terrible report that shows how connected all parts of China‚Äôs economy are. Real Estate is also in trouble. Because of Evergrande, home sales by value dropped 20% in August alone. Morgan Stanley also cut earnings estimates for Chinese property companies by 13%. These are not numbers you see in a growing, booming economy.

# How Xi will buy me a yacht and a roadster

[Fill be up, baby. I will build the largest penis shaped rocket when I become a billionaire from YANG](https://preview.redd.it/f4zarynm7on71.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c9e2fc705c9ad5353fd475b866aae029a5bb8e2)

At 9:30 I will be opening 1000 $YANG January 2022 65 Calls. I believe that a collapse of China can send $YANG on a rocket to $65 and beyond. Through my advanced quantitative models, I see my calls being worth upwards of $5 from their current $0.5. Throw in some IV increase, and it might be a 20 bagger.
