As many know, Discord was in talks with Microsoft to be bought. Since the announcement there's been radio silence. Despite this, Discord was recently in the news again for banning NSFW servers from IOS. This could mean two things; A, Discord is scared of Apple taking notice and being banned from the appstore as a result of the ongoing lawsuit (Apple v Epic Games); B, Microsoft's top dogs are combing through every negative aspect that needs fixing before acquisition. I believe the ladder as Discord is definitely looking to get money ASAP but hasn't announced anything. In my opinion it'd be worth while to buy MSFT. It'd also might be worth while to hold on to the stock a bit longer while Microsoft would move Discord's server hosting to MS Azure hence strengthening their own platform. Take this with a grain of salt though as I'm in high-school and haven't invested in stocks.
