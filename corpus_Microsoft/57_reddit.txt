That’s my first DD so go easy on me. Just last week I learned how to read, write and do math so sorry for possible mistakes. Nevertheless, I believe Avepoint (AVPT) will fly again and I think it has a 50% upside potential over the next year. This is not a stupid pump n dump play and I would really hope not to see idiots gambling on AVPT and then blaming "short ladder attacks" if it goes down.

Every ticker after "deSPACKing" has suffered. Lucid went down from 56 to 21, PTRA from 28 back to its NAV price of 10, BARK from 18.5 to 7.31. Avepoint (AVPT) from 16.5 to below 9.66 as of writing.

Avepoint has been in business for 20 years and is the largest independent software vendor of SaaS solutions to migrate, manage and protect data in Microsoft 365. It has offices in the US, Canada, Australia, South Africa, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland, Japan, Singapore, and China.

2 weeks ago Avepoint reported their Q2 earnings. They managed to beat the estimates once again:

· Total Revenue of $45.3 million, up 38% year-over-year

· SaaS Revenue of $20.6 million, up 76% year-over-year

· Non-GAAP Operating Income of $3.3 million;

You would expect a stock price to go up when it beats earnings, especially, if it trades below its former net asset value (NAV). Well unfortunately (or fortunately, if you are trying to accumulate) the stock went South together with all the other de-spac companies after their mergers.

[I was told crayons are important](https://preview.redd.it/js27eld66rj71.png?width=987&format=png&auto=webp&s=231fdef646a3f60234b76de64ce126a635b095d4)

They expect further growth for the Q3: total revenues between $51.5 and $53.5 million and annual 2021 revenues of about $200 million. That means they are trading at just 8.8 P/S of 2021 with an annual growth of 38%. And if we project at least a 30% until 2025, that would mean their revenues would reach $571 million. Given that they are a SAAS company, that sounds excellent and way better than industry average.

Given that their business is based on a long term relationship with Microsoft, as Azure is growing, AvePoint will continue to grow as well. Therefore, Avepoint should be considered a long term investment. It’s market capitalization of less than 2 billion does bring volatility, however, the future outlook is green.

There are 5 analyst [ratings](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=AVPT) and all of them are a "BUY". They have an average price target of $15 per share and the highest price target was given by Goldman Sachs ($17).

Unlike PLTR, where insiders have been selling heavily, AVPT CEO just last week purchased additionally $936k worth of shares himself. That shows strong conviction in the company and that he believes the shares are undervalued.
