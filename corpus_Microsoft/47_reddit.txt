Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 13th, 2021.

# **Markets brace for hot consumer inflation report in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/10/markets-brace-for-hot-consumer-inflation-report-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Investors are paying close attention to any reading on inflation these days, and the consumer price index will be the big one to watch in the coming week.
*****
> The latest snapshot of the economy comes just a week before the Federal Reserve’s important September meeting. At that meeting, the Fed is expected to discuss more details about its plan to taper down its bond buying program, or quantitative easing.
*****
> Market professionals say a hotter inflation reading could speed up the Fed’s plans to slow the $120 billion a month in bond purchases. The paring back of its asset purchase program would be the Fed’s first major step away from the easy policy it put in place to combat the pandemic.
*****
> The consumer price index is expected Tuesday, and there is retail sales data is released Thursday. They are expected to show consumer prices jumped at a 5.3% annual pace in August, according to the consensus estimate from FactSet, while the consumer continued to pull back from the high spending levels of earlier in the year.
*****
> # Hot CPI
> “If the CPI is hotter than expected, it could make the difference between a September announcement for tapering or waiting to November,” Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said.
*****
> Economists expect CPI to rise at a 0.4% pace month over month. The report comes after August’s producer price index — which was released Friday — showed a jump of 8.3% year over year, due in part to supply chain constraints.
*****

*****
> The Fed’s formal announcement about tapering its bond-buying program, also called QE, is widely expected in November or December. Many of those who had expected a September announcement pushed back their time frame to later in the year after August’s employment report showed just 235,000 jobs added, about 500,000 less than expected.
*****
> “Certainly the trend has been for the inflation number to come in above expectations. I think if that happens again, it will feed the narrative that high inflation is going to stick. Obviously, it’s an issue for the bond market if it’s viewed at all as accelerating the timing of the QE tapering, and or accelerating the timing of the first rate hike,” CIBC Private Wealth U.S. chief investment officer David Donabedian said. That would be a negative for stocks.
*****
> “If markets have an inflation mutiny here and there’s volatility as a result, they could move it up to September,” Donabedian said of the Fed’s taper announcement. “But I think there’s kind of a one in four likelihood in my view.”
*****
> # Stagflation?
> That combination of higher inflation and slower spending, particularly after August’s weaker jobs report, has spurred talk about the threat of stagflation. Those worries have also increased as economists ratchet back growth forecasts for the third quarter to a still high level just above 5%, from above 6%.
*****
> “I’m more about the ‘flation’ side of it than the ‘stag.’ I think the economy is going to perform fine right through next year,” Donabedian said. He said the slowdown in consumer spending after stimulus checks had boosted retail sales earlier in the year is not surprising and may be just a “short-term warning.”
*****
> “We had this explosive growth in retail sales early in the year as a direct result of stimulus payments and vaccines coming and a burst of consumer optimism. It’s really settled down now,” he said. “There was an enormous amount of liquidity and saving and they spent what they spent out of that extra amount of savings and you’re going through a bit of a retracement here, which is why you’re seeing economists mark down their third quarter estimates. Consumer fundamentals are pretty good.”
*****
> Barclays chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen said he expects the CPI report to show that inflation is peaking, just as the Fed has said. But he says the slowing trend is not just an issue for consumer spending. It is also showing up in business spending and housing.
*****
> “With where labor markets are, August was a bit of an egg. But growth in employment has been solid on average, very robust over the course of the year,” he said. “Even though employment disappointed in August, hours and and earnings were still pretty good. There’s income there for consumers to spend. We’re looking at this as a short-term hiccup.”
*****
> Gapen said third-quarter economic growth may be somewhat slower than expected. However, he said some of the lost growth could show up in the fourth quarter.
*****
> “It has some characteristics of stagflation, but true stagflation is rising unemployment and rising inflation. We don’t have that,” he said. “These are bottlenecks that are kind of constraining the pace of the recovery and lead to higher inflation. Demand isn’t the problem right now. Supply is. The unemployment rate is still coming down and employment is improving. It has the whiff but I wouldn’t call it stagflation.”

*****
> Donabedian expects higher prices and shortages to continue into next year, as supply chains keep getting disrupted. Some companies, including PPG and General Electric, have already commented on how they see issues with supplies stretching into 2022. Donabedian expects to see more warnings ahead of the third-quarter earnings season.
*****
> Stocks were lower this week, with the S&P 500 losing 1.7% to 4,458. The closely watched 10-year Treasury yield has held above 1.3% and was at 1.33% on Friday.
*****
> A number of strategists expect to see the stock market pullback during the typically choppy September and October period. Some say the Fed’s September meeting could be a catalyst, especially if the central bank sounds particularly hawkish.
*****
https://i.imgur.com/IP5Vq9T.png
*****
> “We’re up over 30% in 2019, over 18% last year and over 21% in the first months of this year,” Donabedian said. “These are unsustainable rates or return. ...Our takeaway is it’s going to get tougher from here. Valuations are somewhat extended and this whole incredibly supportive policy framework is going to get a little less friendly.”
*****
> # Now watch Congress
> Donabedian said it will be important to watch discussions in Congress as it begins to put details around the infrastructure spending and what type of tax increases will be proposed to pay for it.
*****
> “They’re going to start to fill in the blanks on where the money is going to be spent and what taxes and tax rates are going to be written into the legislation,” he said. “It’s the overall corporate tax rate, it’s the tax on foreign earned income, capital gains rates and dividend tax rate. These are big investor related issues.”
*****
> He said the market has been ignoring the tax issue. “Those sort of issues went quiet over the summer but it’s back full bore over the next two weeks. It will get a lot of attention.”
*****
> The tax decisions could have big implications for corporate earnings, which have been a big driver of the stock market’s gains. “One very direct way that could go wrong is if you get a large set of tax increases that go into effect in 2022. That’s a direct hair cut,” he said.

> # Beige Book Decelerates As Delta Impact Widens

> Earlier this week, the Federal Reserve updated its twice-quarterly qualitative assessment of the economy based on conversations with business contacts across the twelve regional districts. For each Beige Book release, we apply a natural language processing algorithm to assess the relative frequency of positive versus negative words, giving us a quantitative comparison of Beige Books over time. As shown in the chart below, our index of Beige Book activity has fallen from record levels recorded back in June to elevated but much more modest levels in September. That's consistent with the Fed's description of "moderate" growth thanks to the impact of the Delta variant.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/091021-Beige.png))**

> In the second chart below, we show the relationship between GDP growth and our Beige Book Index from above. As shown, the current reading of our index equates to GDP growth of a bit less than 4% YoY. But keep in mind that extreme base effects are still driving wild YoY GDP readings. With that in mind, the Beige Book Index appears to be showing above-trend but decelerating growth, when accounting for base effects of the extremely low GDP reading from Q2 of 2020.

> # Most Heavily Shorted Stocks

> Over the course of 2021, we have seen some aggressive short squeezes, resulting in turmoil for certain financial institutions and millions in profits for some retail traders. The "reddit army" has gone after multiple stocks, most notably Game Stop (GME) and AMC (AMC). Let's dive into the 25 companies in the Russell 3,000 currently with the highest short interest as a percentage of float. Of these 25 companies, only 8 have experienced positive returns in 2021, and 6 have seen their share price half. Since GameStop peaked in late January, 20 of the companies on this list have lost value, and 9 have seen their equity trade down by 50%. Since AMC's peak in early June, 7 companies have seen price appreciation, and zero have seen their value decrease by 50%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/Russell-3000-Highest-SIPF.png))**

> The average short interest as a percentage of float for the entirety of the Russell 3,000 is 3.46%, but certain sectors have much higher proportional short interest than others. Consumer Discretionary, Health Care, and Real Estate have the highest, while Utilities, Financials, and Consumer Staples have the lowest. High levels of short interest is a sign of negative investor sentiment, but certain sectors will consistently have higher figures due to the riskiness of their business models.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/R3000-Sector-Short-interest.png))**

> To dive deeper, let's look at the average short interest in each industry. Retail, Pharma & Biotech, and Consumer Services have the highest levels, while Banks, Tech Hardware, and Utilities have the lowest levels. The average short interest in the retailing industry is more than three times higher than that of banks for companies in the Russell 3,000.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/Industry-avg-SIPF-Russell-3000.png))**

> Although there are many exceptions to the rule, in 2021 equities with higher short interest have generally underperformed the remainder of the Russell 3,000. The average return for equities with short interest between zero and ten percent were higher than that of equities with 33%+ short interest.

> To support this, let's undergo a decile analysis. The stocks in the top 20% in terms of short interest have significantly underperformed the rest of the Russell 3,000 since GME hit its highs. While the equities in the bottom 20% of short interest have averaged a 22.23% return since January 27th (GameStop's top), the top 20% of most heavily shorted stocks have declined by 1.40% on average.

> # Largest 25 Stocks in the S&P 500, Now vs 20 Years Ago

> Yesterday, we took a look at the makeup of the S&P 500's largest 25 companies in 2021 and compared it to that of 10 years ago. Today, we will be extending the study to 2001, twenty years ago right before the 9/11 attacks. On the day before 9/11, the sectors with the largest number of components in the top 25 in terms of market cap were Consumer Staples, Health Care, Technology, Financials, and Communication Services. While all of these sectors still hold a spot in the current top 25 list, the makeup has shifted substantially. Energy and Industrials, which each accounted for 8% of the top 25 companies in 2001, now have zero representation in today's list. Consumer Staples also reduced its count from five to two.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/sector-breakdown-top-25-stocks-now-vs-2001-v2.png))**

> Only four companies that made up the list of top 25 names in September 2001 remain on the list today. Those four companies are Microsoft (MSFT), J&J (JNJ), Walmart (WMT), and Pfizer (PFE). The average return of these four equities, excluding dividends, is 221.81% with a median of 129.58%. While the turnover of this list has been high over the last 20 years, every member of this list is still in operation today, but two have been undergone mergers (Time Warner & Royal Dutch Petroleum). Interestingly enough, the members of this list have approximately the same proportionate makeup of the S&P 500, with only a 1.89% increase in the weightings of the top 25 stocks now relative to September 2001.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/09/2001-vs-2021-biggest-comps-SP500.png))**

> The US economy today is far different than it was in 2001. As it has changed, some companies have adapted and experienced massive growth, while others have been left in the dust. Apart from the two companies that are no longer independently publicly traded, the average return of the 25 largest companies from 2001 is 92.94% with a median return of 49.08%. Over that same period, the S&P 500 has returned 310.61%.

> # September Seasonal Pattern: Weakness After Mid-Month

> September is the final month of the third quarter and historically it is essentially tied with August as worst month of the year. Since 1950, September is ranked last for DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, have fared slightly better, but historical average performance is still negative. Over the last 21 years, September has generally opened tepidly with mixed performance depending on index with Russell 2000 often rising the most through mid-month. However after mid-month, any gains have tended to fade quickly and turn into losses by month’s end. Sizable losses in 2001, 2002, 2008 and 2011 weigh heavily on average performance.

> # September quarterly option expiration week: S&P 500 up 13 of last 18

> September’s option expiration week is up 59.0% of the time for S&P 500 since 1982. DJIA and NASDAQ have slightly weaker track records with gains 53.8% of the time and 56.4% of the time respectively. However, the week has suffered several sizable losses. The worst loss followed the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001. In the last eighteen years, S&P 500 and NASDAQ are tied for best record during September’s option expiration week, up thirteen times. Friday had been firm with all three indices advancing every year 2004 to 2011, but S&P 500 has been down eight of the last nine since.

> # What Could Happen The Rest of the Year to Stocks and Bonds?

> This week in the latest LPL Market Signals podcast, Ryan Detrick and Lawrence Gillum discussed global central bank policy, recently weakening economic data, and where stocks and bonds could go the remainder of this year.

> In today’s blog we will focus on their discussion on stocks and bonds.

> The S&P 500 Index was up more than 20% by the end of August for the first time since 1997 and it has made a new high every single month this year so far (9 for 9). Incredibly, it made 53 new highs before August was over, the most ever. Any way you slice it, this year is historic for the bulls.

> The catch (and there’s always a catch) is the S&P 500 hasn’t pulled back 5% all year, with the last 5% pullback last October. Not to mention September is the worst month for stocks the past 10 years, 20 years, and since 1950.

> But history says that great starts to a year tend to see continued strength the final four months. “Looking at the previous top 10 starts to a year ever, the final four months have gained eight times,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “So should we see any seasonal weakness, we’d use it as an opportunity to buy before likely continued strength.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, 2021 ranks as the 6th best start to a year ever. The previous top 10 best starts to a year averaged a return of 4.0% the rest of the year, with a very solid median return 5.4%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.8.21-Blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**

> Turning to bonds, we continue to expect higher yields due to the growth and inflation outlook, with a target of 1.75% on the 10-year treasury yield by year end. This of course could pressure bonds, as they trade inversely with yields.

> From a portfolio point of view, we would keep overall interest rate sensitivity muted and favor mortgage-backed securities and short- to intermediate-maturity investment grade corporates. As a result of our higher rates call, we suggest being underweight longer maturity high grade corporates or long-term treasuries, which are more sensitive to rising rates. So sum it up, taking a more of a defensive posture as it relates to interest rate sensitivity makes a lot of sense the remainder of 2021.

> Also, the potential this week for a European Central Bank (ECB) announcement on tapering could push European yields higher, which in turn could push U.S. yields higher as well.
