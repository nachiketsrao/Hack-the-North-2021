Analyst Report:

# $PSFE (Paysafe) the most undervalued fintech play on the market. Popular analyst Steve Grasso has been calling for it to triple.

Using the lower end of Paysafe’s forecasted EBITDA ($500M), $1.5B revenue, an EV adjusted for $1.8B debt, and applying the post-merger pro forma 720M outstanding shares, here are Paysafe’s potential share prices based solely on sector peer **EV/EBITDA ratios:**

⁃ PayPal : $269B EV/ $4.47B EBITDA

    	= 60.2x &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Paysafe $28.2B EV / SP: $39.28

Note: Most of these companies have negative earnings and smaller margins than Paysafe.

I’m not suggesting it’s worth this much, but for reference, averaging the above multiples would put BFT/Paysafe’s share price at $135.98

More realistically, taking the average from the lowest four puts the share price at $50.75.

Paysafe is the number 1 digital wallet in Igaming and is used by the top sports gambling company Draftkings. As all SPACs do now, it sold off big today with the ticker change so there has never been a better time to buy than now!

Essential DD on PSFE:

Paysafe is the #1 global leader in iGaming payment processing. “At Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.”

Partnered with Coinbase, Roblox, Draftkings, Spotify, Fortnight, Amazon, Twitch, Microsoft/Xbox, bet365, ApplePay, Youtube, Visa, Betfair, PayLease, ESL Gaming, Luckbox, Amelco, and Pointsbet among many others.

Voted “Best Omni-Channel Payment Solution”, “Payment Processor of the Year,” and “Best Payment Method”

Paysafe has the #2 digital wallet globally with a presence in 120 countries. They own Skrill, which is enabled for CTC trading.

In Europe, where Paysafe is more known, Trustpilot rates Paysafe as “Excellent” (4.7/5 stars) with over 29,000 reviews, and Skrill as “great” (4.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews, while PayPal is rated "bad" (1.2/5 stars) with over 17,000 reviews. They are currently laying the groundwork for their US expansion.

Unlike any other payment processor, Paysafecard enables those without bank accounts or credit cards (the over 1.7 billion “unbanked”) to engage in online commerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY.

Paysafe’s industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are slow to enter. CEO Philip McHugh: “When we talk about a deep and a wide moat, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit where it’s hard to copy.…We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It’s a real strength of ours. We’ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we’ve upgraded the team, we’ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.”

In Q1 Paysafe had $90 million in one-time expenses associated with merger and paying down $1.2 billion in debt. This means without those expenses they would have beat analysts estimates and, going forward, they are well positioned to beat analysts EPS estimates for the rest of the year.

Recent debt management, saving around $92 million annually, secures higher margins and higher profits which will lead to raised price targets and positive price action catalysts.

Paysafe confirmed they are on track to meet 2021 growth projection which doesn’t include planned inorganic M&A growth pipeline and iGaming expansion (55% CAGR).

From 2017 to 2019, under Blackstone/CVC stewardship, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion. (28% CAGR) 2020 saw revenue stagnate due to Covid-related business closures and high-risk channel exits but, even so, if you add 2020’s performance, 2017-2020 still amounts to a respectable 18% CAGR, roughly the same as PayPal’s current projected growth.

Buy rating from all seven analysts covering Paysafe, with 50-70% upside from current price but, with everything noted above, it’s clear that Paysafe would still be significantly undervalued when compared to a basket of comps (PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, bill, GPN, and Paysign) with a collective growth rate of \~12.5% (in Paysafe’s 10-13% range):

Paysafe's price based on sector peer multiples:

EV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75

EV/Rev ratio : $44.64

EV/FCF ratio : $44.18

Average :$46.52

Valuation Notes:

* Removed all high outliers in each category putting PSFE at $100+
* Unlike Paysafe's reported $362 million in free cash flow (on track to increase 29%) and 30%+ EBITDA margin, half of peers report negative EBITDA growth and a third report negative EBITDA and negative free cash flow.
* Paysafe has better EPS than over half of the peer group
* Paysafe has better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them

Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, Bill Foley, has a proven track record in generating value for his investors through rapid synergistic inorganic growth. This is a key strategic pillar for Paysafe. Over the last five years Foley has grown Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B). He also grew FIS from $2.5 billion to over $91 billion (36.4X). He says, “Those characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.”

TLDR: No reason for the price drop besides increasing short interest on the stock. Highly undervalued and should easily be 3x the current price minimum. It will weather the pandemic as shown with an earnings beat. High potential for short squeeze however great value/growth stock.

Buy the DIP.
