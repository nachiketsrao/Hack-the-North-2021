 

Not a political post!

The Supreme court decision today is sending the financial relief decision back to the lower court but a favorable ruling regarding the unconstitutional FHFA director position.  In hours, Biden Admins have already removed the FHFA director.

**Quick history:**

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been in government conservatorship since the 2008 housing crash.  In 2012, the FHFA decided to take all the lambos for themselves and sweep the money into the treasury when the companies turned a profit.  The congress at some point realized that they could not end these companies because of stonks so shareholders still exist.  In 2019, Fannie and Freddie were finally allowed to retain their capital to the tune of billions.  Many apes agree that Fannie and Freddieâ€™s current woes largely resulted from them being used as a political scapegoat but to top it off, the former FHFA decided the two companies would need to raise $283B to be released.

**Enterprise Value (EV):**

To give you an idea what these companies are worth, Fannie and Freddie service half of the mortgages in the United States.  They are a cash and dividend paying cow.

I'm curious what would happen if we send this stock to its proper valuation, $10, $20, $50, or $100+? Would this force the government to sell their senior preferred shares?  The relief sought by shareholders would entitle them to $124B, rapid raise in share price and future lambo paying dividends.
