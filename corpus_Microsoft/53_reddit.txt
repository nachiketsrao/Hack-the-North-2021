This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. I have also added the Week-on-Week stock price change due to popular requests. 

Happy Independence day to all of you! S&P 500 hit a new high (1.7% WoW increase) following Friday’s strong job report (U.S. economy added 850,000 jobs, the most in 10 months). This marks S&P 500 rise for the 7th straight day, the longest winning streak since last August. Even though the market had a strong rally, almost all the popular stocks took a significant beating in the past week.

This is the first time where all the popular stocks except SPY ended in red the same week. This week's stock returns also illustrate the need for effective diversification of your portfolio!

WISH continues to be the most discussed stock, but its sentiment took a significant beating following the 17% drop in the stock price in the past week (dropped to 4% from 46%). The best performing stock on the list was BlackBerry which almost recovered all its losses following the company’s earnings report. A newcomer to the top 10 list is Virgin Galactic following the announcement that its next spaceflight test will carry founder Sir Richard Branson.
