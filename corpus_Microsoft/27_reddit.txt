This post isn't meant for apes that are currently busy throwing their money on some commie stock that el presidente Xi is hell bent on f*cking over. This post also isn't meant for those who can't read newspapers and failed to spot this:

Short story:

˝Intel said Monday it had landed a U.S. Department of Defense pact for an undisclosed sum to manufacture advanced microchips through its contract-manufacturing unit for the first phase of a broader program.˝

First phase of a broader program...

Finally somebody figured out that having most of microchips being produced on an island that China has a hard on for isn't the best idea.  

As part of governments ˝made in America˝ program Intel will invest in new factories in Arizona and expand existing capacity. 

On Taiwan they screwed over Apple and AMD and booked most of TSMC's 3nm capacity for the next year.

In Q1 2022 they will also release their new gpus. Rumors say that Intel's top of the range gpu is on par with Nvidia's 3070. 

If they manage to pull that one of and flood the market with a decent number of graphic cards - they will be flying to the moon just based on that one.  

Plus generally speaking they are swimming in cash.

Yeah I know this post is a bit gay and requires reading one linked article but I just had to post some fucking alternative to endless stream of posts about fucking BABA - a company that can be fucking delisted with one snap of Xi's fingers.

Everybody is talking about how cheap $160 BABA is and I'm just here facepalming at endless stream of people basically giving away their money to Xi. 

WISH literally just happened... Did apes learn anything? Nope they collected what remained of their bananas and are rushing to hand them over to daddy Xi...

Regret not buying nVidia, Microsoft or AMD when they were $50?
