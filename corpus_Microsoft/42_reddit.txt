Severely beaten down because of slack acquisition hate.
Earnings beat by over 130%.
If it were not for the slack deal, this would be mooning due to the fantastic earnings and outlook. Has lost a lot more in valuation than what it is paying for slack buyout.Already down from 270 to 220 in the last 4/5 sessions, and will be back over 250 in no time.

IF THERE EVER WAS FREE MONEY IN ANYTHING, THIS IS IT. maybe go a bit further out maybe april to guarantee safer tendies.
