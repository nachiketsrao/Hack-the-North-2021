I saw alot of DD on Paysafe that got me interested on Paysafe. Just to share my alternate DD, not on projections but valuations. How is Paysafe so much undervalued compared to other spacs. Bill Foley took paysafe public at a valuation of 9B with 4B debt. This valuation was conservative as Paysafe did not have any growth in 2020 due to Covid.

2B of the money was used to pay the debt which means investors got a good deal at $10 with market cap at 7B. Which means either Bill Foley paid 2 billion more or blackstone received 2 billion less. Either way, investors got a 2B discount. Fast forward to now, the market cap is at 6 billion with revised upwards guidance for the year at 1.55b compared to 1.5b, with 23% growth excluding divested business. This is impressive as in just over a year, they grew from 0 growth to 23% growth and increasing their operating income margins from 10+% to over 30%, helping them to their first ever net positive income quarter.

However, as we know shorts attacked it just as any SPACS. What separates it from other SPACS was the valuation initially at 9B was already undervalued unlike many clean energy SPACS which has lofty valuation and unrealistic projections. Paysafe was projected base on 0 growth in 2020, and a mere 10% annual growth.

Furthermore, given many recent fintech acquisition such as square acquiring of afterpay is upwards of 20x revenue. FB and Paypal have both indicate they see the digital wallet segment as a game changer, whereby Paysafe is already a established player in the segment for 10 years and is still further growing due to igaming. Microvision being a rumored acquisition for microsoft sustain its p/s ratio at over 800. In comparision, Paysafe p/s ratio is now under 4. I can assure you NONE of the SPACS out there has a p/s ratio under 10, with POSITIVE NET INCOME. 

The last confirmation that their stock is undervalued is management decision to acquire pagoefectivo and paysafety in an all cash deal as compared to recent acquisitions made by draftkings and square using solely stocks.

So why such a steep drop. It was up 10% premarket initially due to earnings beat. Look what I found. AGAIN SHORTS ARE COMING. Short interest is at 5% at 17M already reported at JULY 30TH with around 50% short volume daily. IT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY BY NOW. DAILY volume on average is 4m which means any squeeze would require shorts 4 days to cover. THEY HAVE TO BUY AT LEAST 4 DAYS WORTH OF THE ENTIRE FLOAT TO COVER, JUST LIKE ANY OTHER SHORT SQUEEZES. 17m more shares already floating around. Share price would rocket further if shorts are forced to cover. PLUS many in the wsb community have already entered prior and are diamond handling now.

I am sure everyone have seen different analysis all putting its target price from 15 upwards to 45. USING BELOW EXAMPLE, THEY HAVE GROWTH, VALUATIONS, FINANCIALS TO BACK THE SQUEEZE WHERE NO INSTI WILL EXIT. Those who would, would have already exited. This is the best short squeeze play around in my opinion as shorts blindly attack it cause its a SPAC. 

Looking at a larger basket of comps with a collective growth rate of \~12.5% (not far from Paysafe’s minimum 10.6% projection) here are valuations based on PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, bill, GPN, and Paysign among others:

Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples:

EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09

EV/Rev ratio : $83.91

EV/FCF ratio : $87.86

Average: $97.95

After eliminating outliers with highest multiples:

EV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75

EV/Rev ratio : $44.64

EV/FCF ratio : $44.18

Average :$46.52

Notes:

1. Unlike Paysafe, around half of these competitors report negative EBITDA growth and a third report negative EBITDA and negative free cash flow.
2. Used low end of Paysafe's projections and factored in debt and high-end of potential dilution.
3. As noted Paysafe’s 10.6% rev growth projection excludes planned inorganic M&A growth and projected 55% CAGR iGaming growth, which constitutes a third of their revenue.
4. The above comps were taken during a sector-wide pull-back and do not reflect recent fintech gains since Jamie Dimon’s "enormous competitive threats" comment.

This is not any financial advice, but I am just a nerd that all in on Paysafe at 8.2. Only when we unite, we become stronger and earn from short sellers.

Btw, Grasso tweeted and hes still holding for his 45 pt too.
