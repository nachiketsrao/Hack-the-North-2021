Maybe this reads like a diary entry, but fuck it, if this one's not on your radar already then check it out if you like digital ad plays like MGNI and APPS.

My last post on PERI (Perion) from about a month ago when it was trading at about $10 got a little bit of love, and it has been a wild ride on this low-float bastard since then. Hit $17.85 a couple weeks ago before a massive short attack drove it down to sub $12, and it has since settled in nicely at the $14.00 to $14.50 range on decent volume everyday this week. They just presented at the Needham conference this week and put out a nice little investor presentation that confirms their current growth is looking primo. Check it out [here](https://www.perion.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/perion-IR-deck-20210112.pdf) 

Bottom line: 4-year $800 million Microsoft contract is confirmed, nice expansion into the CTV space with 232% quarterly growth in revenue since Q3 in that sector, and expected revenue of over $100 million in Q4 (they report earnings on February 9th). 

Yes, that's correct, this company has more revenue than MGNI and APPS right now, and is trading at 1/8th the market cap of MGNI and 1/13th the market cap of APPS. Sure it may have a lower potential growth rate compared to those two, but its trading at a market cap of essentially 1:1 revenue, which is absolutely unfucking heard of in this sector. It has run up about 100% since early December already, and it's still trading at that big of a discount. That's how much room this puppy has to run.

And guess who else knows how much of a steal this valuation is? Aunt Cathie and ARK have added over 120k shares since early December when I last posted. They currently have 286K shares as their #1 largest holding in their IZRL ETF. Check it out [here](https://ark-funds.com/wp-content/fundsiteliterature/holdings/ARK_ISRAEL_INNOVATIVE_TECHNOLOGY_ETF_IZRL_HOLDINGS.pdf). 

In my opinion, this thing has a lot of gas left in the tank to run in 2021. All analysts following this thing (which, granted, ain't a ton) have a buy rating and one just upgraded the target price to $18. Yeah yeah, analysts don't know shit (yada yada yada), but it tells you where a few of the wall street boys want this thing to go.

Anyway, it's late in the day and I need a beer, so I'll finish my rant, but if you are into digital ad plays and want something that isn't trading at its peak yet, check this one out (or don't, doesn't matter to me). Remember boys and girls, this thing has a microfloat of only 21 million tradable shares (comparable to CRSR), it's volatile, it swings like a mofo on a daily basis, and it runs into the occasional short attack. But if you love this daily volatility and long growth prospects heading into 2021 (like I do), then take a look.

tl:dr: read the post, it ain't that long. ARK loading every week, $800 million contract with microsoft, Q4 revenues looking spicy.

My Positions: 40 contracts of April 10c (up over 300% and the thought of selling hasn't even crossed my mind). Also shares.
