Welcome back to the WSB DD Summary! This is for 4/28-5/1. I’m your host and resident autist u/expander2. You have to be able to read to gain anything from this so that rules out about half of you. As always, ticker is in bold on the left and what I deem "important" is near the top of the post. A TLDR, plays, and previous DD summaries will be at the bottom. My last posts still stand and hold some good info so check it out for more plays if this isn't enough for you greedy fucks.  


Honestly, all the DD posted in the last few days has been absolute shit so I’m sorry that this summary has been bad. Mondays post will be better I hope. When all the DD that is posted is 5 sentences that say a bunch of bullshit that even the dumbest of fucking retards can understand then nothing good can happen here. So you fucks that post shitty DD that you made up on the spot are dumb pricks that need to go back to investing or just shut the fuck up. Keep your shitty opinions to the daily threads, don't clog up the feed with your diarrhea. So FUCK YOU. 

Sincerely,

The people of WSB

Now I will get off my soapbox and give you assholes what you come here for.

**MTCH;** I have talked about Match before and pretty much said the same thing I'm gonna say here. [This post says all](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9na5t/why_mtch_will_be_your_next_1000_play/) you need to know. They own shit ton of the online dating industry and practically have a monopoly on that market. They own Tinder, Match, PlentyOFish, etc. and because of the lockdown the number of users on each of these applications are up by a lot. Overall, it’s a safe bet to think that their profits are going to go up. They release earnings on 5/5 so it's looking to be good. Watch for a run-up before in anticipation of high earnings. If there is a run-up then sell before earnings and lock in your gains if you're smart. Calls for 80 look good to me.

**GOOGL;** [This post breaks down](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g9zct3/alphabet_earnings_call_writeup/) everything that Alphabet said during their earnings call. I am not going to summarize a summary so just read it for yourself if you're interested.

&#x200B;

**A Reminder;** Now this is something I've never done and this is to remind you of plays that I have recommended in the past. First is Activision. My post from [4/21-4/22](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g68ny9/dd_from_421422_activision_tyson_square_and_gains/) recommended Activision, Tyson (which panned out) and Square. They are making money hand over fist from their new games and will continue as long as we are in quarantine. I am personally in Activision for 5/8 for 78c and 79c. Read my ATVI writeup because I am still confident in this play. I would also like to recommend Echostar again with their earnings coming on the 13th. People are still upgrading their internet plans through HughesNet (which is owned by Echostar), and SATS is pushing new satellites that will increase internet speeds. Their earnings should be great. I wrote a post on it on [4/14-4/15](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1x0y4/dd_from_414415_echostar_hasbro_yelp_and_shit_tldr/) so read that for more info. I stand by both of these which is why I am reminding you. Money is still to be made here.

 

Good luck fuckers and tune in on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for more WSB DD Summaries!

**TLDR;** You guys suck at DD, Match will go up, Alphabet did pretty good, Activision is still a good play, Echostar is still a good play.

**Plays;** MTCH 80c for 5/8, ATVI above 68c for 5/8, SATS 35c for 5/15.

DISCLAIMER; I am not personally advocating for any play that I add to this list. I merely go through a couple of days of posts and find what I think is competent DD. PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK.
