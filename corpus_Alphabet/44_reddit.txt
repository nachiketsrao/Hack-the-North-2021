Alright, as promised in some comments last night I’ll give you retards some buy sentiment for Palantir.

WHO AM I AND WHY GIVE A FUCK

I am a big tendie eating retard that works military intelligence for the Marine Corps, I worked Palantir before they stopped funding. (Don’t let that scare you). I bought in day one around lunch, if you wanna see DM me and I’ll provide receipts. Additionally I’m now 135 shares in and opened 5 call contracts.

Military use of the program is simply not  “spying on you” bullshit they’d have you eat up on the 🌈🐻 articles that cause our tendie machine to slow down. In fact military intelligence is legally prevented from conducting intelligence on US Persons. I can’t speak for other actors in the Intel community but it’s expressly forbidden on my end. Palantir doesn’t enable us to spy on you, but it allows for us to compile data and speed high level decision making up at a rate that was simply beyond expectations previous to utilizing it. What does that mean? Well for one, if you provide military organizations with success in ‘killing bad dudes’ then they’ll always have you in their pocket. I say if your taxpayer dollars are funding a program, you might as well double down and buy what you’re already paying for. I wouldn’t bet against a country that nuked another...twice. We can talk about Japan more later tho.

Commercial use? The fucking cuck circus over at shitron fails to see that they’re reliably and consistently expanding business. France, South America, Africa, JAPAN 🇯🇵 (should’ve put Japan first but stuck with caps to provide a bit less of a smooth read for you autistic cunts.) I’ll elaborate that. Japan has been historically tough for US companies to break through to, but Sompo and its associates are big Palantir and we shouldn’t be taking that lightly. The uses for Palantir are unlimited and can greatly improve over time, with new products ie. Palantir Apollo. The market for data collected or data synthesis isn’t ripe with competitive companies like the 🌈🐻s would have you believe. Sure snowflake and other peers have similar mission but none have the same reach and same customer specific outreach and development cycle. I can’t express enough how much of a buy this is.

Palantir as a company. This is huge because it speaks volumes about where they could go. Palantir was operating shy of 20 yrs before their listing, and they’ve been increasing the amount of ‘news’ on their site loading up on contracts all over the globe. Sure their operating losses are scary at first sight but they’re dumping heavily into R&D, building new SaaS as mentioned before and expanding heavily into the commercial market. Karp is the new Jobs, or even the next Alphabet CEO. Palantir is headed to household notoriety. Expect it, sooner than you can imagine it’ll be everywhere, even Queen Cathie bought in. 

TL;DR 
I wear camo and hate life...but Cathie, Japan, and Biden are fucking fueling our little rocket, next stop, fucking Jupiter
