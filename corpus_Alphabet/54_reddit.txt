Welcome back to another edition of the Weekend Discussion Thread. Fifth trading week of the year has finished. 

As a tradition that started forty-four Fridays ago, the first three commenters in each Weekend Discussion Thread will get a flair if they don't already have one, a flair change, or to designate a flair for someone else.

Notable earnings for [the upcoming week](https://i.imgur.com/s0La6HO.png).

Verify dates on your brokerage platform in case of errors/changes.
