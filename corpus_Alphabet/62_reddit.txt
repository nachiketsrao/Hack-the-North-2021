I'm expecting more than 15% annual returns on Alphabet every year until they start paying dividends, at which point I know their development has slowed. 

Google is the god of technology right now. The future is not decided by more efficient materials or better resources, it hinges on two things:

1. Machine learning algorithms

2. The availability of big data

And who dominates the market in both of these areas? The og google search function is a gold mine, as well is youtube, chrome browser, and every single one of their mainstream products. Facebook doesn't even come close.

All in on GOOGL to double the S&P500 at zero risk.
