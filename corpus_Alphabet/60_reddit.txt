Alright autists--pull up a chair, grab a tub of cheese balls, change the password on your wife's IRA so she doesn't find out you dropped $20k on TLRY FEB 26 $100C that literally couldn't go tits up, and get ready for papa MRE to tell you a story.

Everyone back? Great. I know you Asperberger laden assholes can't read too good, so I'll do my best to give you TL;DRs in emoji form. Skim if you wish--I would.

**Numbers Overview & Leadership**  
**TL;DR** \- 🔢👌

NASDAQ: **RAVN**

|Market Cap|$1.5B|
|:-|:-|
|Shares Outstanding / Float|35.9M/35.4M|
|% Held by Institutions|80.07%|
|EPS\*|0.61|
|P/E\*|69.78|
|Price/Book|4.63|

\*I know numbers make some of you dizzy, and I wish I didn't feel like I needed to include this, but for you fellow tards that keep investing in companies that don't have products yet, EPS is Earnings per Share and P/E is Price to Earnings. These things mean the company is actually making money.

Looking back, the company got pretty fucked by COVID. Their EPS dropped from over $1.00 in 2019 to the $0.61 listed above in 2020, but their earnings have largely recovered as of Q4 2020 ($0.28 in 2019 vs $0.24 in 2020).

Also of note, they "indefinitely suspended" (read axed) their dividends in 2020 to more aggressively invest in their growth areas.

Overall, there's nothing exceptional about those numbers. My key take-aways were that, unlike some other companies in the sectors Raven is in, the price isn't insanely inflated. The fact that over 80% is held by institutions (Blackrock, Vanguard, and Thrivent are the top 3 holders, all of whom added last quarter) is also reassuring.

As for the leadership, no one really stands out as an all star or an asshole. The CEO/President is a home grown dude who started at the company as an intern back around the time of Christ. Everyone is about what you'd expect--a dude with a masters from MIT, a buncha dudes with MBAs, etc.

**Bottom Line--this isn't some artificial hyped up bullshit.**

&#x200B;

**History**  
**TL;DR - 🥣🏭+👴💭+⌛➡🎈🏭**

Let's go back in time. To the time of dinosaurs. 65 whole years ago--when the contiguous 48 was the only 48. Some chucklefuck busts into his boss's office at the cereal factory they work at.

Chad: "GOD DAMNIT. IM DONE WITH THIS SHIT HARRY. MAYBE THIS BETTY CROCKER MAKING, ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE SPONSORING BULLSHIT IS NOT FOR ME. MAYBE I WANT TO FLY."  
Harry: "Sounds good, Mr. Chad, sir"  
U.S. Navy: "AND MY AXE"

And boom. A Raven baby.

"*MRE, I don't understand* 😖😢"  
Fuck I gotta spell everything out huh?

Back in 1956, a bunch of duders working at General Mills (yeah, of cheerios fame) High Altitude Research Division, broke off to form Raven Industries after their big brained leader, Ed "Chad" Yost got a $47,000 grant from the US Navy after he built and flew a tethered hot air balloon.

You remember all those old "ITS A UFO"/"Nah bitch it's a weather balloon" stories? Turns out a bunch of those were made by our boy ~~Ed~~ Chad--both from his time at the cereal station and from Raven itself.

"MRE THAT SOUND LIKE AN OLD COMPANY 😭. I DONT LIKE BOOMER SHIT 😓😥"  
Yo shut the fuck up. If Pfizer (founded in 1849) is still around and providing ~~little blue~~ fat green gains, you bet your undescended testies that a company like Raven can do the same. But I hear you. That was then, this is now. What's Raven done for me lately?

**Raven Aerostar**  
**TL;DR - 🎈🕵️‍♀️🏋️‍♀**

Decades later, Raven still gets some of those fat military contracts. [Last month](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/raven-aerostar-and-persistent-systems-network-constellation-of-stratospheric-balloons-in-comms-demo-301217001.html), they demoed a platform where they use a constellation of stratospheric balloons to create an on demand, low cost, reusable, wireless networking system above battlefields or other points of interest.

These aren't your kids party balloons. And Dorothy, these aren't the wizard's balloons either. They have a bunch of different types created for different things. Some of these things go to the edge of space--Remember that dude who drank too many redbulls and jumped out off a balloon? That was Raven. You remember Google/Alphabets Loom project where they were going to float hot spots around the earth using balloons? Yeap. Raven.

In 2015 NASA needed to test their Supersonic Decelerator. To do that, they had to drop it from the edge of space. Guess how they did it. You bet your ass it was a big fucking balloon made by Raven. Raven got a special award for that, btw. But that wasn't the end of the relationship. In 2020 alone, NASA threw \~$3Mil at Raven for all sorts of weird studies--cosmic rays, the magnetosphere, atmospheric sciences, seismic events on Venus--they used balloons and raven for ALL that shit.

"MRE. I don't give a fuck about balloons."

Well, you should. Along with that shit above, Raven's balloons have a bunch of capabilities that have yet to be fully realized simply because we don't have the technological capability to use it. Lets say, for example, that we wanted a worldwide network of autonomous delivery drones. What if there was a platform that could float around providing both a charging base and a warehouse simultaneously? Amazon has already thought of doing this with blimps/airships (I don't want to mislead you, there have been no public discussions between amazon and Raven that I've found, but I am sure that Raven would be a leading candidate to build them). What if you want to carry 8000lbs of fuel up to 110,000ft and let your futuristic spacecraft or drone or whatever refuel when it gets there? What if you want to go and survey an alien planet? Balloons can do all that shit. They can lift a shit ton of stuff for cheap, they're semi-autonomous and can control where they're hovering, and they stay up for MONTHS at a time. I get it, though, fuck balloons I guess.

Raven Aerostar also makes:

* Military Radars and early detection systems
* Payload recovery parachutes (think rocket parts falling back down, high altitude payload drops, etc)
* Stratospheric airships
* Aerostats (which the army keeps buying)
* Various "Dry suits" and other PPE

"Wait. Dry suits? Why?"

**Raven Engineered Films**  
**TL;DR - 👩‍🔬👨‍🔬🧪➡👩‍🌾👩‍🚀🥗🎈🏠**

You thought "Raven Industries" was just Aerospace and Defense? Fucking. Wrong. Raven is a conglomerate. For you smoothbrained fucks, that means it's a business slaver. Its a business that makes money by owning businesses that actually do work. These include Raven Aerostar (Aerostar International, Inc. and Aerostar Technical Solutions), but also other shit.

When Raven started doing crazy shit with balloons, there literally weren't companies making the materials that they needed. So what did they do? Started making it themselves.

Along with the various materials for the balloons, Raven learned to make all sorts of materials. Ultra-thin, ultra-light films? Check? Thicc ass fiber reinforced shit? Check. Everything in between? double check. Seriously. You want some shit to wrap around your plants so you're not wasting water? How about shit to put over one field while another one is being fumigated? What if you wanted to build a temporary structure to keep something warm while a more permanent structure was being built? What if you had a shit ton of nasty ass shit that you didn't want leaking into mama earth (land fills, fracking water, etc)? What if you had a fuck ton of cotton that you had farmed but if it got wet, shipping bills would be \~5x more expensive? What if you needed to ship some veggies across the country? You ever see those half built houses getting carried down the road with big ass pieces of plastic on them so you can't see in the living room? What if you want to build your own living room but you got argon seeping up out of the ground? Yeah... All of this is Raven. And I'm just scratching the surface. I was going to try to cover everything, but fuck I still need my fingers to buy FDs. [Go look for yourself](https://ravenefd.com/products). Then check out [geomembranes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomembrane#Applications). And again. that's just one of their products.

And they have all sorts of ways to do this. They do blown film (heh), cast film, sheeting, laminating, coating, and basically anything you could think to do with large pieces of single materials.

So they're fucking with space, military, farmers, builders, energy, and more. They got flying shit, beeping shit, floating shit, anti-seeping shit. Honestly it's kind of hard to stay on track writing all this. Speaking of staying on track, though...

**Raven Applied Technology**  
**TL;DR - 🚜+💻+🛰=🥗🍅🍊🥔🥙💲💲**

Yeah. I get it. This is long as fuck. I'ma keep this part short. Raven one of the leaders in autonomous farming tech and precision agriculture. Want to make the best possible use of some specific land and get that bitch farming itself? Raven is the company to call. They make and use field computers and GPS to measure with sub-meter accuracy and then provide the data crunching to plan it all out. They even have a software suite designed to enhance efficiency on the office side of farming businesses.

Also of note--they acquired an autonomous agriculture startup "SmartAg" as well as majority ownership in another autonomous tractor startup "Dot Technology Corp" at the end of 2019  (they acquired the rest of DOT in 2020) and have been folding their stuff into Raven's pre-existing systems ever since--the first revenues from this acquisition are probably just now coming to fruition, with much more potential.

**Review and Future**  
**TL;DR** **-** **💹 $50-65 End of March, $70-90 EoY**

So if you're keeping up Raven is an established company that came from (at the time) futuristic ideas and has recently made moves showing it's still looking toward the future. At the base of this growth, it already has:

* Long standing relationships and active contracts with both the US DoD and NASA
* A ton of products with space and futuristic applications
* Ownership of production for proprietary materials used in aerospace, construction, farming, and just about everything else
* Autonomous agriculture solutions and precision agriculture planning software

Fuck this sounds like something Mama Cathie would like.

Because it is. ARKQ currently owns 3.33% of RAVN, and that number has been increasing. Cathie has been using the past few red days to buy some shit on sale, but she's also been **buying RAVN at 52 week highs.** She's bought RAVN 4 out of the last 5 trading days (excluding today, or maybe not--I don't have that info at time of writing).

I'm not gonna spout some bullshit about guaranteeing it'll be in ARKX. Anyone saying something is a lock is just lying to you. Mama Cathie does as Mama Cathie wants and we'll all fucking like it. That said, I would be extremely surprised if it's not a consideration for her.

So where do we go from here? Just like the balloons, we go up. Obviously. Nasdaq has been doing its best to keep this bird's wings clipped the past few days, but RAVN has been growing regardless (at least prior to today--may have finally gotten it to come down temporarily, but I'm not ruling out a late rally). Regardless, I'm looking at hitting a new ATH around $50 (\~$1.7B valuation)before the end of March (sooner if NDX can quit being a bitch). If it's added to ARKX, I think $60-$65 ($\~2.3B valuation) could be realistic in that same time frame. Because of their re-found focus on growth (again, shown by their cutting dividends to reinvest) and recent strategic acquisitions, I'm targeting $70 (\~$2.5B valuation) without ARKX or $90 with (\~$3.2B valuation) EOY.

Also, I started writing this before the market opened and just now got back to it. I didn't update any of the numbers and made very few changes. Also, I didn't spell or grammar check it. Again, fuck you.
