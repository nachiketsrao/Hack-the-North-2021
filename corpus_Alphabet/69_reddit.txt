Hello, friends -

It's me, Fuzzy. Welcome back. I know, I know. I'm excited too. I had this up at market open but it got spiked by automod \*twice\* so I'm hoping third time's the charm. 

Did you guys see that movie, *The Accountant*? The one where [Sad Ben Affleck](https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5ab58b2922f093031d9fb8fa/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/Fry-The-Great-Sadness-of-Ben-Affleck.jpg) plays an autistic accountant for organized crime who doubles as a stone-cold killer? Yeah, me neither.  I mainly remember it exists because it features Anna Kendrick, a Fuzzy Fave (TM). In the March Madness for my heart, she's a 4 or 5 seed in her conference for sure (look out, u/pokimane). Anyway, that's what we're going to be talking about today. No, not March Madness (never got the fuss) or Sad Ben Affleck (21st century existential icon) - not even Fuzzy's Faves. Today, we're all about bean-counting - specifically, EBITDA, the magic number that makes all of your accounting problems disappear. I figured it was time you autists got to learnin' how businesses can lose money on paper but still be in the green with their creditors - especially at the moment, what with the bat flu and all, when many businesses are trying to explain that no one should panic and they're still in the black (even though they're definitely not). Let's get started.

Now - disclaimer - I am **not** an accountant (obviously). If you are, feel free to flex in the comments and explain to me how mastery of forward-looking deduction writeoffs or some other fucking word jumble would make me a more complete human and save me $0.03 on my taxes every second five-year rolling addback window. The thing is, like most people that wind up on the human facing side of the finance industry, I cared too much about getting laid in college to give a shit about how to make numbers dance on a P/L statement, so I never really bothered to learn much more than the basics.  Once you hit the real world, though, those pocket-protecting calculator jockeys get preeeetty important, pretty fast. Tax, forensics, regular ol' corporate book-keeping - in business-land, you name it, you need an accountant to either do it for you or sign off on it before you send it to the board. So, you know, accountants. Not all bad.

Anyway, even though I'm not an accountant, one thing I **do** know a lot about is EBITDA. Why? Because it's one of the most hotly contested battlegrounds of modern corporate finance, so I deal with it every day. "But Fuzzy! How can you negotiate something that's an established accounting concept? Isn't that like trying to change 2+2 so it equals 5?" And the answer - if EBITDA was a regular accounting concept - would be yes. But fortunately for borrowers, private equity cowboys and corporate finance lawyers (as well as lovers of weasel words everywhere), it's not, so you can. See, there's a difference between GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) and... well everything that's not GAAP. You can't fuck with GAAP. How something \*becomes\* or even \*became\* GAAP in the first place... unclear. I guess in ancient times some bespectacled prophet came down from Mt. Nerd with spreadsheets carved on stone tablets, and whatever was on them wound up being generally accepted. I don't know, I'm not a fucking theologian. But however it happened, you can't fuck with it. Happily, though, EBITDA is non-GAAP, so like all the best girls, it's whatever you want it to be.

But we're getting ahead of ourselves. Today's post is going to be a tale of two halves. We're going to go through what EBITDA is and why it's important, and then we're going to go through a meme-tastic example to show how it can be manipulated - using everyone's favorite manufacturer of tendie-powered cars, rocketships, and flamethrowers... $TSLA!

If you want to play along at home, here's [$TSLA's 10-K](https://ir.tesla.com/static-files/07bfcb70-aba1-4a27-af09-4f101678320c). Now I know people get all hot and bothered about $TSLA for whatever reason (did you know there's a dedicated Tesla investors subreddit? fucking weird). So let's get this clear from the jump - every single company does this, and I'm not implying that $TSLA is doing anything 'wrong' or 'bad'. I don't give a shit about the ticker or the cars or Elon's mission to put weed on Mars or whatever the fuck he's doing these days, so don't come at me in the comments about any of that shit. They're just the example we're using to work through this exercise. They've actually got a fascinating debt structure that is worthy of its own post (Musk or his family can take it private at any point without triggering a change of control under the docs... what?!), but today we're limiting our scope to the way they're allowed to calculate EBITDA.

OK. Ready? Let's do this. Sincere and/or funny questions in the comments answered as always.

1. **EBITDA - A User's Guide**

When it comes to people, it's pretty easy to measure performance. Where you went to school, how much you make, where you live, how hot your wife is, how long... you get the idea. The point is that life is full of concrete, objective measures to help you figure out how worthwhile (or not) you really are as a human. Stretch out to the "All Time" view on your RH graph to give yourself an idea of where you sit.

Businesses have a bunch of these metrics they can look at. Profits, cashflow, sales... the list goes on. The issues with most of those, though, is that running a business is a pretty complicated job. There's a whole lot of shit that goes into those numbers each financial year, and not all of it is necessarily indicative of the 'normal' baseline of performance. Maybe you have a bad quarter because of the 'rona (pour one out for $WFC..... yikes). Maybe you get slugged with a tax bill, or a big interest repayment from your bank. Now that might hurt your operating profit on a one-off basis, but it's not something you expect to keep happening. You don't want your shareholders to freak out over nothing. That's where EBITDA comes in (say it like EEE-BIT-DAH).

EBITDA stands for **E**arnings **B**efore **I**nterest **T**axes **D**epreciation and **A**mortization. The idea is essentially to find that baseline - to produce a number which reflects the true earnings of the business when the pernicious influence of taxes, financing, and accounting is taken out of the equation. Basically, you calculate it by **adding back** non-cash expenses to your baseline operating income. That's it. Simple, right? "OK Fuzz, but what's a non-cash expense? Couldn't that be like... anything?" Exactly.

Because EBITDA as a concept is more malleable than your more... black and white metrics, borrowers like to use it in loan documentation - particularly in leveraged finance, where it typically serves as the measure of earnings for the company. It's also used as a building block of incurrence baskets - the higher your EBITDA, the more you get to utilize under a particular basket. Usually this is done by way of a either/or construct - you can have $50 million **or** $25%  (or whatever) of your EBITDA, whichever is greater. It also turns up in financial covenants and step-downs in asset sale sweeps, excess cash flow sweeps, and pricing. There's a bunch of other non-finance ways it gets used too, but we're just going to stick to this for now.

Sometimes companies will try and flex their 'record EBITDA' numbers in a 10-K. But if you read on, you'll see  that every time they do this, it's qualified by the fact that it's non-GAAP and not accepted blah blah blah. So just be mindful of that when you're reviewing those documents and always read the real numbers before you make a call on how the business is actually doing.

Anyway, let's see how it can be manipulated.

2. **Cookin' With Elon - The $TSLA Example**

Let's take a peek under the hood of [$TSLA's Credit Agreement](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000119312519095913/d625340dex1068.htm) to see what's going on with their EBITDA. Remember how I said you could calculate EBITDA by just adding back non-cash expenses to operating income? That's right... in theory. Have a look at this (just skim it, reading it cold will give you a headache. I'm going to break it down for you anyway - this is just for illustrative purposes):

>“Consolidated EBITDA” shall mean, for any period, Consolidated Net Income for such period (without giving effect to (w) any extraordinary gains or losses, (x) any non-cash income, (y) any gains or losses from sales of assets other than those assets sold in the ordinary course of business, or (z) any foreign currency gains or losses) adjusted by (A) adding thereto (in each case to the extent deducted in determining Consolidated Net Income for such period (other than clause (ix) below which need not be so deducted)), without duplication, the amount of (i) total interest expense (inclusive of amortization or write-off of deferred financing fees and other original issue discount and banking fees, charges and commissions (e.g., letter of credit issuance and facing fees (including Letter of Credit Fees and Facing Fees), commitment fees, issuance costs and other transactional costs)) of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries determined on a consolidated basis for such period, (ii) provision for taxes based on income and foreign withholding taxes for the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries (including state, franchise, capital and similar taxes paid or accrued) determined on a consolidated basis for such period, (iii) all depreciation and amortization expense of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries determined on a consolidated basis for such period, (iv) in the case of any period, the amount of all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transaction (including in connection with any amendments to the Credit Documents) during such fiscal quarter, (v) any unusual or non-recurring cash charges, (vi) any cash restructuring charges or reserves (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include retention, severance, system establishment costs, excess pension charges, contract and lease termination costs and costs to consolidate facilities and relocate employees) for such period (a)(x) incurred in connection with an Acquisition consummated after the Effective Date or (y) otherwise incurred in connection with the Company’s and its Consolidated Subsidiaries’ operations in an aggregate amount for all cash charges added back pursuant to this clause (vi) not to exceed 15% of Consolidated EBITDA in any Test Period (calculated before giving effect to this clause (vi)), (vii) any expenses incurred in connection with any actual or proposed Investment, incurrence, amendment or repayment of Indebtedness, issuance of Equity Interests or acquisition or disposition, in each case, outside the ordinary course of business for such period, (viii) expenses incurred to the extent covered by indemnification provisions in any agreement in connection with an acquisition to the extent reimbursed in cash to the Company or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries and such indemnification payments are not otherwise included in Consolidated Net Income, in each case, for such period, (ix) proceeds received by the Company or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries from any business interruption insurance to the extent such proceeds are not otherwise included in such Consolidated Net Income for such period, (x) all other non-cash charges of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries determined on a consolidated basis for such period, (xi) \[RESERVED\], and (xii) any expenses associated with stock based compensation and (B) subtracting therefrom (to the extent not otherwise deducted in determining Consolidated Net Income for such period) (i) the amount of all cash payments or cash charges made (or incurred) by the Company or any of its Consolidated Subsidiaries for such period on account of any non-cash charges added back to Consolidated EBITDA pursuant to preceding sub-clause (A)(x) in a previous period and (ii) any unusual or non-recurring cash gains. For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that, to the extent any amounts are excluded from Consolidated Net Income by virtue of the proviso to the definition thereof contained herein, any add backs to Consolidated Net Income in determining Consolidated EBITDA as provided above shall be limited (or denied) in a fashion consistent with the proviso to the definition of Consolidated Net Income contained herein

Yowza. That's a mouthful, huh? So in this bullshit alphabet soup are some key phrases that we are going to look at to see how businesses can manipulate their YOY figures to appear a bit... better than they would be otherwise. There are your normal should be in there things too, but most is bullshit. Let's pick out the five big ones. My comments on how these can be manipulated are in ALL CAPS after each one.

(1) Transaction costs (with respect to both closing date transactions and other permitted transactions) THIS BASICALLY MEANS THEY CAN SPEND HOWEVER MUCH MONEY THEY WANT ON WHATEVER THEY WANT AS LONG AS IT'S ALLOWED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AND THEY CAN ADD IT BACK. THEY CAN ALSO INCLUDE ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH LAWYERS (BECAUSE WE'RE EXPENSIVE), ACCOUNTANTS, CONSULTANTS, WITCH DOCTORS, STRIPPERS... YOU GET THE IDEA. THIS IS ONE WAY THAT CASHFLOW NEGATIVE COMPANIES CAN HAVE A POSITIVE EBITA - YOU SPEND EVERYTHING ON MORE SHIT AND YOU GET CREDITED FOR IT. TSLA ARE A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF A COMPANY THAT WOULD USE THIS ALL THE TIME BECAUSE THEY ARE ALWAYS IN ACQUISITION OR DEVELOPMENT MODE. ALL THAT CRAZY SHIT ELON DOES THAT PISSES AWAY MONEY WOULD GO RIGHT HERE AS A CREDIT TO THE BUSINESS.

(2) Cash restructuring charges / reserves (capped at 15% of EBITDA) DOWNSIZING, CONSOLIDATION, FURLOUGHING PEOPLE, PAYING TO GET PEOPLE KILLED - IF IT MEANS A CHANGE TO YOUR BUSINESS THAT INVOLVES MOVING PEOPLE AROUND OR GETTING RID OF THEM, YOU CAN ADD IT BACK HERE. SAME GOES FOR CASH RESERVES YOU'VE ESTABLISHED. GET A DOUBLE CREDIT FOR SPENDING **AND** NOT SPENDING MONEY!

(3) Pro forma cost savings projected to be realized from any material business acquisition (exceeding > of $60 million / 1% of total assets) THIS ONE IS ALWAYS FUNNY TO ME. THE IDEA IS THAT IF YOU BUY SOMETHING THAT COMPLEMENTS YOUR EXISTING BUSINESS, EVEN IF IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS ACTIVELY LOSING MONEY, YOU CAN GET A CREDIT FOR THE SYNERGIES IT WILL HAVE WITH YOUR EXISTING BUSINESS. COMBINE WITH ADDBACK (1) ABOVE FOR A REALLY GOO TIME - DOUBLE DIP ON BUYING CASH BURNING BUSINESSES AND JUST TELL PEOPLE IT'S SYNERGISTIC. WOO, FISCAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING!

(4) extraordinary losses PRETTY MUCH WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE. IF SOMETHING FEELS WEIRD TO YOU, YOU CAN PROBABLY ADD IT BACK HERE. THERE IS NO BASELINE FOR THIS. IT'S WHATEVER YOU WANT IT TO BE AT ANY POINT IN TIME AND THE BANK CAN'T STOP YOU.

(5) unusual and/or non-recurring cash charges WHERE YOU CLAIM WRITEOFFS FOR YOUR CEO'S WIFE'S BOYFRIEND'S SECRET FAMILY IN OMAHA'S CHRISTMAS PRESENTS. YOU CAN SERIOUSLY USE THIS FOR WHATEVER YOU WANT AS LONG AS YOU CAN SAY IT'S (I) NOT SOMETHING YOU'D DO EVERY DAY AND (II) IT PROBABLY WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN. INTERESTINGLY SOME BUSINESSES ARE TRYING TO CLAIM CORONA-RELATED CREDITS HERE TO STEER THEM THROUGH THIS EARNINGS SEASON WITHOUT HAVING TO DEAL WITH NEGATIVE EBITDA.

This is just $TSLA, and honestly their definition isn't even that complicated. Seriously - go to your favorite ticker's 10-K, find the credit agreement, and CTRL+F "Consolidated EBITDA" and "Consolidated Net Income". Try and read it for yourself and tell me if you think that makes up anything other than a shitty madlib - let alone a real performance metric for a business.

Anyway. That's today's post. $LYV breakdown later in the week. $LULU on Friday.
