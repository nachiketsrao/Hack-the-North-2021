This is why $CLOV will grant you a stupid amount of money. First off Chamath Palipitiya has meme god status coming to him. We all know it.

Earlier this month renowned billionaire Chamath Palihapitiya brought Clover Health public through a SPAC. This was part of his SPAC series which he plans to revolutionize funding to companies. Clover Health is poised to change the way we see healthcare because of their use of Artificial Intelligence. They plan to use AI to discover high risk patients before complications arise to provide them with the best care possible. Sort of like Precogs from the minority report.

Father Chamath believes there are many things that make CLOV special. The main one being that it is undervalues Chamath has said that he believes the valuation to lie between 20-30 billion dollars while it is currently in the few billion stage. He likened it to Virgin Galactics SPCE. This is because people weren't able to grasp the concept of space travel going mainstream, he says the same realization is bound to hit Clover Health. This company is more of a technology company which allows it gain a great amount of investor support and funding. One of these investors which backed the startup was Alphabet - "Google".

Financials wise CLOV is still kicking ass. Clover was able to increase their revenue to close to 50%  in the past year. The IPO has only given it more money to increase infrastructure across America. They are currently located in 7 states of which 34 counties are effectively taken over. This allows the company a huge rate and area of growth to flesh into. 

As always do your own DD before hoping aboard.

Positions: OTM Calls into next year.
