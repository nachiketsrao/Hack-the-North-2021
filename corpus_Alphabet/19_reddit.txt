Let's talk about GOOG! They just came off a killer earnings season with a EPS of $27.26 vs. estimates of $19.34. In addition, their revenue hit $61.88 billion vs. estimates of $56.16 billion. Significant portions of it came from youtube ($7 billion) and cloud services ($4.6 billion). GOOG's CBO spoke of retail as a growth driver to the ad revenue within the earnings call. Alphabet looks to be poised to continue substantial growth. With a strong performance, I am forecasting consistent 20% revenue growth. GOOG holds very little debt and has 666.8 million shares outstanding. They also hold over $26+ billion in cash. GOOG has a WACC of 5.5%. Currently, GOOG has a price per share of **$2,733.00**. Based on my valuation, it is currently underpriced. GOOG also has a slightly positive alpha. 

**J.N. Price Target:**  **$3,293.68** 	  

**Average Analyst Price:**  **$3,143.81**
