Nokia is a sleeper 5G play. Earning could be released February 4th and with these new contracts they are gonna smash earnings. The hype just started Friday so we can still get in early.

Because I'm a broke bastard I only have 1 01/20/23 5$ call that I paid 75$ for.

Up 5 dollars so far ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ my retard brain is happy.
