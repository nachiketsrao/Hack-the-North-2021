First I would like you to (re)read this post where i explain the link between real rates and nasdaq valuations [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls5gdh/buy\_qqq\_puts\_real\_rates\_out\_to\_wreck\_your/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls5gdh/buy_qqq_puts_real_rates_out_to_wreck_your/)

Then I want you to go look at this chart

And finally i want you to remember the beyond amazing earnings we had from main QQQ heroes (baring that piece of shit ticking time bomb that is TSLA)

but as a reminder, you can check earnings estimate for technology here [https://www.yardeni.com/pub/if-ste.pdf](https://www.yardeni.com/pub/if-ste.pdf)

Right now QQQ is trading at 29x Next twelve month's earnings

Earnings shall be revised up & i let you conclude with regard to that 29 number and what that does to QQQ 

Now to adress some questions : **Why are Qs so shit since the earnings ?** 

**I've identified 3 themes let's discuss all of them :**

A) Chips shortage story which is now correctly being identified as an issue with double (and triple) ordering from asian clients - This is a problem for the "value" semis (MU & friends) not the super structural growth semis (NVDA & friends, though NVDA has another problem called ARM and AMD another problem called XLNX) - My view on SMH is not really bullish but contrary to what people may think it's not that big a deal for Qs and you can just avoid them if you pick another etf

B) MTUM Rebalancing : Momentum N-12 Type strats are supposed to reduce their tech exposure in favor of banks and such which leads to a lot of HFs trying to front run this move. it's a may thing and should be over very soon

C) the most important one : This idea that a lot of ppl are selling big winners to reduce their tax bill because Biden will probs manage to increase cap gains tax. Due to a lot of reasons which are not important to us in effect, this is more something that some "smart" HFs are trying to front run than something which actually exists. This sets them up for a massive squeeze < 17 May

Besides these little quircks QQQ is FAR below where it should be given the EXTREMELY NEW ACCOMODATIVE stance that the FED is giving us and the EXTREMELY GOOD earnings. 

some sellside analysts already have a 5K target for AMZN since the earnings ... 

**TLDR Buy QQQ 350 for any expiration after 17 May depending on your risk tolerance**
