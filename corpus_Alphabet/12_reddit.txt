Historically, Class A shares have always traded for slightly more, because Class A shares have voting rights attached to them. This itself has a small amount of value, and historically, this has reflected a slight premium vs. Class C shares.

Class B shares are not publicly traded, they're held by insiders and have 10x voting power.

Class C shares have no voting rights at all.

So why in the fuck is GOOG (Alphabet Class A) at $1,270.86 per share and GOOGL (Alphabet Class C) at $1,275.88 per share?

This is completely fucking irrational.

Are we in an advanced simulation? Algorithms run the markets, machines have sentience, computer is having a joke, and humans are dumb as fuck.

Can anybody seriously give me an answer? Because that's my best theory.
