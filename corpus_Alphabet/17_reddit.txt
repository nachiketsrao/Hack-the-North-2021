Question in title

Based on current prices, it seems like people are willing to pay a $6 to $7 premium to surrender the right to vote. Historically, A has been $10-40 higher than C because large shareholders can use a large number of voting stock to influence company decisions. Current prices are probably wonky because of a large sale of A-class shares late on Friday, without markets being open long enough to correct this anomaly.

Unfortunately markets are still closed, and selling C-class for A-class now is not really possible.
