Ironically, Musk has no desire to accumulate wealth for the sake of buying things or controlling governments. He wants capital to (1) save Earth and (2) colonize Mars.

Nearly all of his net worth is currently tied to the share price of $TSLA, so how does he extract cash without selling shares and pushing his net worth down?  I know, I know, what a lovely problem to have!

But seriously, how can he maintain his net worth while extracting cash?

Someone recently suggested to Musk that he change his corporate structure to resemble Alphabet. Elon replied positively.

The Plan: restructure $TSLA into a holding company which then acquires, one-by-one and only when the timing is perfect, each of his private companies.  Musk receives a direct cash payout for his share of each private company.

Elon gets cash, $TSLA holders gain various private companies. $TSLAâ€™s share price fluctuates, but never crashes and analysts dive in and attempt to quantify the future value of each new company.
