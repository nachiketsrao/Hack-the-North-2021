To be able to have the chance to be apart of something so historic and potentially life changing. Even if I somehow lose my ass, this whole experience has made me become more informed in investing, more interested in investing, and to achieve the feeling of being apart of something way bigger than myself. I’ve lurked here forever, but never thought anything serious would come from it. 
It’s awesome to know that I can explain this to my kids, because I know in a few years when they get into high school it something that’ll be taught. For every ape and tard that has won or loss, that kept this subreddit going, thanks. Sincerely, I’ve learned more about stocks and investing in the last week then I suspect I ever would have. 
Sentimental things aside, look at all the donations, and positive impacts this whole whole event has brought into fruition. A bunch of crayon and paint chip eating retarded apes really left a mark. 

And it’s not over, hold strong. Diamond hands, let’s go to the moon. I don’t know if we’ll ever have an opportunity like this again. 

(This is not financial advice, I’m definitely retarded. Banana is my favorite number of the alphabet)
