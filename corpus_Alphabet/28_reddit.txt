I believe Citadel and Melvin didn't in any way directly make robinhood and others halt GME buying. They didn't have to.

The [DTCC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depository_Trust_%26_Clearing_Corporation) (clearinghouse) is owned and directed by it's users - literally a consortium of banks and brokers including two of Mr. Griffin's Citadel firms [check the alphabetical list](https://www.dtcc.com/client-center/dtc-directories).I know there are practical reasons it was set up that way, but they've clearly shaped and manipulated it so it can save their asses. 

It's a complete scam that the DTCC is apparently allowed to manipulate order flow the way they have without any impartiality or accountability to the public.

It's why these hearings are and will be a sham that we won't get anything out of other than a few memes, because Congress and investigators know they'll never find a smoking gun by investigating the HFs and brokerages.,
