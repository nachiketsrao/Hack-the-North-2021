While reading through comments on WSB this week, I've seen a fair amount of skepticism regarding some popular price targets for GME. This post is an attempt to bring some context to some of these price targets. 

Consider the fact that, even if GameStop's market capitalization briefly reaches $2T, it still will not be the most valuable company in the world (that title will remain with Apple). **At a market cap of $2T, shares of GME will be worth $28,680.** At a share price of $10k, GameStop's market capitalization will be  \~$700B, less than those of companies such as Alibaba, Tencent, Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple.

Now, from the perspective of fundamentals, it doesn't make sense to compare GameStop's market cap to those of the companies just mentioned. However, in the context of a short squeeze, it seems like a reasonable comparison, especially in light of any evidence supporting the possibility that GameStop will briefly become the most valuable company in the world. And that possibility is quite plausible. 

Remember that Volkswagen became the most valuable company in the world when the price of its shares spiked in the midst of a short squeeze in 2008. You might say, "Well, maybe market caps were more uniformly distributed in 2008, so the bar for VW was lower." Ok, fair point. But at the peak of the VW short squeeze, VW attained a market cap of \~$420B. According to The World Bank (see [https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD)), the total market cap of all listed domestic companies worldwide was $32.27T in 2008, and $68.65T in 2018. So at the peak of the VW short squeeze, VW accounted for roughly 0.42/32.27 = 1.3% of total market cap. In 2018, 1.3% of total market cap was $0.013\*68.65T = $893B. **At a market cap of $893B, GME shares will be worth $12,806.** And this is a conservative estimate, since the current total market cap is considerably larger than it was in 2018.

TL;DR: The price of GME shares could reach anywhere from $12k to $28k. Obligatory  ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€.
