Ok retards, listen up. Just because AMC has performed in lockstep in the past with GME does not mean this will continue indefinitely.

AMC is not GME. AMC’s management has issued a massive amount of shares proportional to previous outstanding shares to pay down their loans and rent, taken on new European debt, and the largest share holder has reduced from >50% to <10% stake. AMC will survive, but only because new shareholders are bailing them out by paying pre-dilution prices for new share offerings which directly allow the company the cash needed to pay their landlords. You aren’t buying value or even contributing to a war chest that can be used for expansion, new shareholders who bought ATM offerings are giving the company cash just to survive. If you love the chain, want to contribute your money to their survival, and are aware of the dilution of outstanding shares (quoted at 450.2 million outstanding during the earnings call last week) then more power to you.  However, if you think AMC is anything like GME you have another thing coming. At least GME has a short squeeze thesis that management isn’t actively sabotaging by issuing shares and Robert Cohen represents hope of future growth beyond what is possible for the business at present.

If you feel differently I would be happy to hear why you believe this company can increase shareholder value to compensate for the share dilution. Please let me know what I’m missing.

Yours Truly,
A smooth-brain who can’t wrap his head around this one

Edit: Ryan Cohen not Robert Cohen. I’m pretty retarded but hey, that’s why I’m here.
