[ On the website, Clover says its currently in 8 states, However, it is actually in 10 states however they haven't released that info yet. Just looking at the growth chart that YOY growth is huge, 2021 I expect will be huge especially if the Medicare age is lowered. ](https://preview.redd.it/jq5j24xe50x61.png?width=1293&format=png&auto=webp&s=82ddbc4ed0d0e6a16074747a2f82a98a28222622)

[ We can also see here, Clover is the fastest-growing medicare company in 2020, simply look at the chart yourself. This rapid growth only accelerates Clovers fuel. ](https://preview.redd.it/cbm19gof50x61.png?width=911&format=png&auto=webp&s=91f623b391031634a4d4f34e84ae39106d516737)

[ Clover is backed by one of the largest companies in the world, Alphabet or Google.   Something that should be pointed out is that Google's partnering with CLOV could be massive. MSFT is investing heavily in healthcare technology. Both company's market cap is 1T+ \(credit to u\/sugardaddy for telling me this\)](https://preview.redd.it/t41zlb3k50x61.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f4ce646c7f99e99d6e2459059aa0688e922057c)

[ Clover is an innovative disrupting company, its mission is to lower the cost of Medicare plans, Clover sees that the healthcare system is broken as healthcare is expensive. What does Cathie Woods love? Disrupting innovation! I think if Cathie saw this stock she'd definitely buy in! ](https://preview.redd.it/vfoqs0rl50x61.png?width=788&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d99f6a09ffd517206fd4233c26dc4c1617c3d47)

[ Clovers growth has been growing rapidly, I do believe 2021 will be a fantastic year for Clover, and maybe report its first profitable quarter.](https://preview.redd.it/fiinjtmn50x61.png?width=1149&format=png&auto=webp&s=2768290fc6df4867fe0d723ca88d3847407d1c5d)

[ This photo shows how the Clover Assistant works, basically, an app that can help you make decisions quick \(here's an example\)](https://preview.redd.it/humhrjmp50x61.png?width=1568&format=png&auto=webp&s=45eb4f36de7f6ab9a88a0c554d3c6f9d64fc463c)

[Pretty nice right! ](https://preview.redd.it/jodctmbx50x61.png?width=920&format=png&auto=webp&s=a888b3f1a2f61c0890395ebd5197a313b2accde4)

**Comparing Clover to Teladoc**

[ Teladoc currently has a 25 billion market cap with a 10&#37; short float. ](https://preview.redd.it/asptmh9060x61.png?width=693&format=png&auto=webp&s=697a12de87dafddde75b9f5e81007f730329e4b2)

[ Clover has a 3.77 billion market cap, with a 30-40&#37; short interest. Teladoc is nearly 6.6x bigger than Clover, if Clover is even half of Teladoc's market cap, it'd be trading around 4x higher.](https://preview.redd.it/qtpq5cj160x61.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e4fb6fd2f277003b6af3428198d0ead0a060086)

[ Looking at the call options, on the 5\/21 expiration, there are a LOT of OI calls for Clover. This makes a Gamma squeeze possible](https://preview.redd.it/8pe4fkf260x61.png?width=1164&format=png&auto=webp&s=0917209919a165bfd026a4835bbb92018309671e)

There is still a lot to be covered, this is only a small part.

TL;DR: Short + Gamma squeeze possible good company backed by Google fastest medicare growth company + possible medicare age lowered which could give potentially millions of more customers for Clover.
