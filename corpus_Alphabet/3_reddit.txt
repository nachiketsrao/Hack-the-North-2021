WSB is famous not only for its handicapped userbase, but for the (surprisingly) high quality DD posts you can come across while browsing this sub.

As a seasoned veteran (more than a week here) I thought it was about time to finally contribute something of my own.

So when the SEC inevitably starts looking into this sub, you can point them to this post as a shining example of our contributions to the **academic world of finance**. Also point them to Citron and its **market manipulating whore mouth**.
