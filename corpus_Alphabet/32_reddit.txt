My inner 🌈 🐻 is coming out and I’m trying to figure out what company to yolo puts on. Sure, google is sitting on fat stacks of cash but what the fuck have they done aside from advertising?  1.stadia overpromised and under delivered.
2.Google+ one of many embarrassments. 
3.Fitbit acquisition looking like another Motorola mistake. 
4.Cuck workforce who protested google’s pursuit for the JEDI contract. 

I know I’m retarded and gay but what the fuck am I missing?
